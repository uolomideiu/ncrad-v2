<p>The NCRAD Executive Committee (NEC) includes clinicians and basic scientists who have expertise in genetics, biomarkers, clinical neurology, and statistical analysis. NCRAD conducts two meetings per year with the NEC and seeks the advice of the committee or individual members when scientific questions arise that would benefit from their input.</p>
