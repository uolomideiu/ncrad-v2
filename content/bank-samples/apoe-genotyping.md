  <p>NCRAD is now offering APOE genotyping for research purposes. NCRAD will receive samples from Investigators, prepare them, and perform SNP testing. A Material Transfer Agreement between NCRAD and the Investigator is required.</p>

<p>An excel sheet containing data for the 2 APOE SNPs (rs429358 and rs7412)as well as the reported and genetic sex for the participant.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please Note:</strong> It is very important to note that these results are only to be used for research purposes. <br/> This test is not approved for clinical use and therefore the data cannot be returned to participants.</em></p>

  <p>This is dependent on the number of samples being tested and how they are sent to NCRAD. Samples sent as DNA will be processed much more rapidly than samples received as blood or brain tissue, which will require DNA extraction.</p>
  <p>Once DNA is extracted and analyzed, data is generated in about 4 weeks.</p>
