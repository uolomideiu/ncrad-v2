::header-block-one{title="Procedure for Depositing iPSCs and Fibroblast lines to NCRAD"}

  <p>To facilitate sample sharing and increase the rate of research discovery, the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD) is banking induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and fibroblasts. In order to deposit iPSC and fibroblast specimens, investigators need to first complete and submit the online <a href="https://redcap.uits.iu.edu/surveys/?s=E3PAAYPNTN" target="_blank" class="link">iPSC & Fibroblast Information Collection form</a>.</p>

  <p>This form requires the investigator to provide information and provide documentation that includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic information about the investigator.</li>
    <li>Specific information about iPSC lines to be deposited.</li>
    <li>Specific information about fibroblast lines to be deposited.</li>
    <li>Fibroblasts associated with iPSC lines are requested to be deposited with the iPSC lines.</li>
    <li>It is preferred that investigators submit 3 vials per iPSC and fibroblast line. This ensures the lab has extra vials in the event of a QC measure failure. Sending less than 3 could result in additional requests for any vials that fail QC.</li>
    <li>Lines with less than 30 passages are preferred. Lines with greater than 30 passages will be moved to the end of the queue and expanded last.</li>
    <li>Provide documentation of mycoplasma testing and karyotyping for iPSCs and fibroblasts to be deposited, if available.</li>
    <li>Please provide any protocols used for iPSC and fibroblast cell culture.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once the iPSC & fibroblast information has been submitted, the NCRAD iPSC team will review the information and contact the investigator with any questions, or request additional documentation. Once the NCRAD iPSC team approves, the investigator will be contacted and provided with material transfer agreement (MTA) documents which are not subject to alteration. After completion, the investigator will be supplied with a shipping kit and instructions to send specimens to NCRAD. Once lines are received, the laboratory staff will conduct a host of rigorous quality control measures. Investigators will be informed of the quality control results for each line deposited.</p>

accordions: - title: What is the cost to deposit lines at NCRAD?
content: <p>Currently, there is no cost to deposit your lines at NCRAD.</p>

    - title: What is the benefit of depositing lines at NCRAD?
      content: <p>In addition to sharing samples to increase the rate of research discovery, your lines will also go through a rigorous quality control process. You will receive quality control results for every line you deposit.</p>

    - title: What paperwork needs to be completed prior to sending samples to NCRAD?
      content: |+
        <p>The following paperwork is required to be completed before we can accept cell lines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href = 'https://redcap.uits.iu.edu/surveys/?s=E3PAAYPNTN' target = '_blank' class="rvt-cta">iPSC & Fibroblast Information Collection form</a></li>
            <li><a href = 'mta_in.html' class="rvt-cta">Material Transfer Agreement (MTA)</a></li>
            <li>A completed manifest</li>
        </ol>

    - title: Why do you need so much information about my lines?
      content: <p>The NCRAD stem cell lab has designed standardized protocols to ensure uniformity and quality control for every line we bank. As such, we require detailed information about your cells to ensure they are transitioned into our laboratory with minimal disruption to the cells.</p>


    - title: What lines can be banked?
      content: <p>NCRAD banks iPSCs, gene edited isogenic iPSCs, and fibroblasts. Please send all of these cell types when possible.</p>

    - title: What kind of testing does NCRAD require prior to banking?
      content: <p>No testing is required. However, please provide documentation of mycoplasma testing and karyotyping for iPSCs and fibroblasts to be deposited if available.</p>

    - title: Does NCRAD bank fibroblasts that are not associated with iPSCs?
      content: <p>Yes, NCRAD banks fibroblasts as well as iPSCs. Please complete the <a href='https://redcap.uits.iu.edu/surveys/?s=E3PAAYPNTN' target='_blank' class="rvt-cta">RedCap form</a> regarding your fibroblasts to begin the process.</p>


    - title: How many vials per sample are requested when depositing fibroblasts or iPSCs with NCRAD?
      content: <p>It is preferred that investigators submit 3 vials per iPSC and fibroblast line. This ensures the lab has extra vials in the event of a QC measure failure. Sending less than 3 could result in additional requests for any vials that fail QC.</p>


    - title: What will I need to ship samples?
      content: <p>NCRAD will send a shipping kit with instructions prior to shipping, at no cost, that will include everything needed to ship, except dry ice. You will need to supply dry ice for shipping. Please do not send samples using your own shipping materials.</p>


    - title: What happens to the samples I deposit?
      content: <p>Our group of talented iPSC technicians will thaw lines and conduct a host of rigorous quality control measures. Only lines that pass all quality control testing will be expanded and made available for distribution. As a depositor, you will be informed of the quality control results for each line you deposit.</p>

    - title: What happens if a line fails any quality control measures?
      content: |+
        <p>We will inform you if your line fails any of our QC measures.</p><p>Any line failing to pass an immunocytochemical analysis, a trilineage differentiation assay and a sterility test will result in the line being discarded.</p>
        <p>If a line fails karyotyping, it will be moved to the end of the expansion queue. We are aware there is some demand for abnormal lines. However, current requests for normal lines far exceed those for abnormal lines and as such, normal cells will be prioritized for expansion.</p>

    - title: What does the biobank do to protect research participant privacy?
      content: <p>The goal of the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD) is to support research focused on the etiology, early detection and therapeutic development for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In achieving this goal, it is also top priority to protect research participant privacy. When sending lines, researchers will not be asked/will not provide identifying research participant information with the lines deposited.</p>

    - title: Will I be able to request other samples from the IUGB at a reduced cost if I contribute samples?
      content: <p>Yes, investigators that contribute samples to NCRAD will be able to request samples at a reduced cost.</p>
