<h3>Source</h3>
<p>Cerebrospinal Fluid</p>

        <h3>Standard Collection Tubes</h3>
        <p>Conical tubes are utilized as the collection receptacle for the CSF upon extraction. 50.0 ml conical tubes are commonly used by NCRAD for this purpose. LP Trays may also be provided for the collection of CSF. These trays may include: introducer needles, plastic leur lock syringes, and lidocaine.</p>

        <h3>Standard Processing Procedures</h3>
        <p>After CSF collection, the entire specimen is inverted to mix sample and centrifuged within 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>CSF is aliquoted into pre-chilled polypropylene 2.0 ml tubes according to the study protocol.</p>

        <h3>Shipment of Samples to NCRAD</h3>
        <h4>Frozen</h4>
        <p>CSF aliquots are frozen at -80°C and shipped back to NCRAD with dry ice pellets.</p>

        <h3>Standard Collection Tubes</h3>
        <h4>Whole Blood and Buffy Coat</h4>
        <p>The EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetra-acetic Acid) tube is utilized in clinical settings to collect whole blood for the purpose of extracting plasma and buffy coat.  The EDTA tube in the kit may be plastic or glass.</p>

        <h4>Brain Tissue</h4>
        <p>Brain tissue specimens transferred to NCRAD are sent in self-standing polypropylene 30 ml tubes.</p>
        <p>Examples of preferred tubes are: DOT Scientific Part number 642; 30 ml self-standing centrifuge tube or Fisher part number 22-044-320; Evergreen Scientific 30mL freestanding centrifuge tube.</p>

        <h4>Saliva</h4>
        <p>The Oragene-Discover Saliva Kit is the only kit currently used by NCRAD for the purpose of collecting human saliva for nucleic acid extraction.</p>

        <h4>Transferred DNA</h4>
        <p>DNA transferred to NCRAD arrives in the required 2.0 ml screw top polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes: DOT Scientific 819-S 2.0 ml screw cap microcentrifuge tubes with O-rings</p>

        <h3>Standard Processing Procedures</h3>
        <h4>Whole Blood</h4>
        <p>EDTA tube is inverted 8-10 times to thoroughly mix additive and sample prior to centrifugation.</p>

        <h4>Brain Tissue</h4>
        <p>Brain tissue specimens are collected per standard procedures of the local institution.</p>
        <p>Approximately 2-5g of tissue is requested to complete DNA extraction.</p>
        <p>Maximize the amount of gray matter; frontal cortex is preferred but any region will suffice.</p>

        <h4>Saliva</h4>
        <p>Saliva kits are only processed in house at NCRAD. Sample collection is per industry released instructions.</p>

        <h3>Shipment of Samples to NCRAD</h3>
        <h4>Frozen</h4>
        <p>Buffy Coat, brain tissue, and transferred DNA aliquots may be shipped back to NCRAD at -80°C on dry ice pellets.</p>

        <h4>Ambient</h4>
        <p>Due to the stability of the sample, the saliva kit may be collected and delivered back to the NCRAD biorepository through regular USPS mail or ground transportation.</p>
        <p>Those EDTA collection tubes that do not undergo processing at the location of collection may be sent ambient via next day delivery for processing at NCRAD.</p>
