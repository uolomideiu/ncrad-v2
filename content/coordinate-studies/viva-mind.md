      <p>Please follow the below link to access the VIVA-MIND Kit Request Module.  This link will direct you to a REDCap database where study coordinators and staff may request kits, individual supplies, and/or labels.  VIVA-MIND sites will use the same link for ordering supplies related to blood-based biomarkers and saliva collection.  Please allow a total of two weeks for kit requests to be compiled and delivered to your site.</p>
