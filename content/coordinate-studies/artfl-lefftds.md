      <p>Please follow the below link to access the PSDC Kit Request Module. This link will direct you to a REDCap database where study coordinators and staff may request kits, individual supplies, and/or labels. PSDC sites will use the same link for ordering supplies related to blood-based samples and for CSF. Please allow a total of two weeks for kit requests to be compiled and delivered to your site.</p>
