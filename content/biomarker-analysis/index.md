<p>NCRAD has expanded its services with the establishment of the Biomarker Assay Laboratory (BAL). It is a state-of-the-art facility equipped with the latest technology and staffed by experienced personnel with extensive knowledge in the field of biomarker analysis. Like all services at NCRAD, the BAL uses standard operating procedures to ensure uniformity and minimize the impact of pre-analytical variables on downstream sample analyses.</p>
<p>The BAL analyzes well-established fluid-based biomarkers to support research studies, allowing for longitudinal quality monitoring and consistent delivery of results over time. The BAL's approach also enables cross-laboratory comparability studies to be conducted to ensure standardized processing and reliable research biomarker results.</p>
