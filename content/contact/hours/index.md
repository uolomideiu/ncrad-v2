::header-block-one{title="What to do for Friday Blood Draws"}
NCRAD is not open for business on Saturday or Sunday; therefore, we ask that no samples be shipped on a Friday. We cannot guarantee the conditions in which the samples will be held by the shipping courier over the weekend. It is important to have plans in place for each type of sample to be held over the weekend prior to shipping. Please refer to the table below for how to handle samples drawn on a Friday.

    When possible, please only ship frozen samples on Monday-Wednesday. There is always the potential for an unexpected shipping courier delay and by shipping Monday through Wednesday there should be enough time to receive the samples before the weekend
