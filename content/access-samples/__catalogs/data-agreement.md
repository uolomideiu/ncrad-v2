  **I request access to data housed at the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD) for the purpose of scientific investigation, teaching, or the planning of clinical research studies and agree to the following terms:**

## Section I: Access, Use, and Safeguards

**A.** I will receive de-identified data and will not attempt to establish the identity of, or attempt to contact any of the subjects with data in NCRAD.

**B.** I will not attempt to identify any specific study sites, unless NCRAD has approved such identification as part of my project’s protocol.

**C.** I understand that distributing these data to a third party is prohibited, and therefore I will not distribute these data beyond the uses outlined in this agreement. A third party is defined as anyone who is not a collaborator or co-author on the analyses defined in my proposal.

**D.** I will require anyone on my team who uses the data, or anyone with whom I share these data, to comply with this Data Agreement.

**E.** I will accurately provide the requested information about persons who will use the data and analyses that are planned using these data.

**F.** I will comply with any rules and regulations imposed by my institution and its institutional review board in requesting and using these data.

**G.** I understand that any data I download may change as new quality assurance measures are implemented and data records are updated.

**H.** I will ensure that Investigators who utilize data obtained from NCRAD use appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent use or disclosure of the data other than as provided for by this Agreement.

**I.** I will report any use or disclosure of the data not provided for by this Agreement of which I become aware within 15 days of becoming aware of such use or disclosure.

## Section II: Data Analysis

**A.** I will respond promptly and accurately to NCRAD’s requests for updates on the status of my analyses.

**B.** I will review the data documentation provided by NCRAD and consult with NCRAD research coordinators in order to ensure the accurate use and description of study data in my analysis and any ensuing presentations or publications, as well as to ensure the understanding of subtle data complexities.

**C.** If more than 1 year passes before publication, I will download an updated dataset to ensure the most accurate and up to date data is used.

## Section III: Publication

**A.** I will include the NCRAD acknowledgement for all samples and data obtained:

> Samples and data from the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), which receives government support under a cooperative agreement grant (U24 AG21886) awarded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), were used in this study. We thank contributors who collected samples used in this study, as well as patients and their families, whose help and participation made this work possible.

**B.** I will acknowledge the work by each specific study that went into accumulating the data and samples and its funding source(s), and will include language in the manuscripts associated with the correct collection. Every study has specific acknowledgement language. As new catalogs are added, additional language will continue to be listed.
