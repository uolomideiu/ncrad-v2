#summary
The African American Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics study (AA AD Genetics) is a multi-center, cross-sectional study that was established to examine genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease among African Americans. The focus of the study was to provide a carefully refined phenotype, including neuropsychological test performance, cardiovascular health, and brain imaging data, for genetic association studies of AD among African Americans.

#subjects

The goal of the AA Genetics study was to recruit a total of 2,000 African Americans age 60 or older. Sites recruited both cases and controls, primarily from community sources and not memory clinics.

#data

The database includes item-level data from medical, functional, and neuropsychological evaluations, as well as diagnostic information. There is a subset of participants with structural MRI data. A fixed minimal dataset is available through the NCRAD catalog. An additional full dataset can be requested from Columbia University.

#biospecimens
Cell Line DNA, Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs)
