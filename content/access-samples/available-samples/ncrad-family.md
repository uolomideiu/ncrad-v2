#summary
The NCRAD Family Study began in 1990 and is still actively recruiting and following subjects. Subjects are contacted annually for updates on diagnoses within their family.

#subjects

Families with two or more members with early or late onset AD and related dementias. Samples are obtained from affected family members and unaffected relatives (typically over age 60).

#data

These families are not evaluated in person and all clinical information is obtained through telephone and medical record review. Therefore, data is limited to the following: family history; demographic data; medical records on the evaluation; diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic subjects; telephone cognitive batter; neuropathological findings when available.

#biospecimens
Genomic DNA, Cell Line DNA, Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs), PBMCs, Fixed Brain Tissue, Frozen Brain Tissue
