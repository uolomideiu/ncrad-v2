#summary

The NIA Genetics Initiative/NIA-AD FBS Study is a multi-site study initiated in 2002 with the purpose of identifying families with multiple members diagnosed with late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (LOAD). Autopsy is offered to all active study subjects.

#subjects

The study requires at least two full siblings with late onset Alzheimer’s disease (symptoms developed after age 60) and a third family member who is either: 1) affected and over age 50; or 2) unaffected and over age 60. In addition, a control cohort was also enrolled. These subjects were enrolled over the age of 60 with no neurological problems such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease or stroke and have no parents, children or siblings with Alzheimer’s disease.

#data

Enrolled family members complete a study visit (in person or by telephone).

Study subjects are followed longitudinally and complete a study visit approximately every 2 years.

The catalog for the NIA-AD FBS Study consists of a subset of variables that can be used to better understand the dataset and perform initial feasibility studies. Sites submit study data quarterly to the study data coordinating center located at Columbia University. This catalog is then updated quarterly after data cleaning is complete. Additional data can be requested from Columbia University:
