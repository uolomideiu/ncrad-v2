#summary
The <a href = 'http://www.dian-info.org/resourcedb/default.htm'>Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network (DIAN)</a> is an international research partnership of leading scientists determined to understand a rare form of Alzheimer’s disease that is caused by an autosomal dominant gene mutation. Understanding this form of Alzheimer’s disease may provide clues to decoding other dementias and developing dementia treatments.

#subjects

Currently enrolling study participants who are biological adult children of a parent with a mutated gene (PS1, PS2, APP) known to cause dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease. Such individuals may or may not carry the gene themselves and may or may not have disease symptoms. This international, multi-center longitudinal study is aiming to recruit 600 individuals: 300 expected to be gene carriers who will develop AD and 300 non-demented controls (siblings).

#data

Participants are evaluated in a uniform manner at entry and longitudinally thereafter with instruments to include: the clinical and cognitive batteries that comprise the Uniform Data Set (UDS) and additional DIAN-specific testing. A full description is available on the <a href = 'https://dian.wustl.edu/our-research/observational-study/'>DIAN website</a>.
