#summary
The Genetic Investigation in Frontotemporal Dementia and Alzheimer's disease (GIFT) study is aimed at identifying novel genes causing or altering susceptibility to Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), by re-sequencing a panel of genes involved in tau metabolism in a large series of well-characterized patients with AD and FTD and controls enrolled in 6 major centers in California and Georgia.

The study formulation and dose of Ginkgo biloba was not effective in reducing incident dementia.

#subjects

The GIFT network includes 5 centers in California (University of California at Los Angeles, San Francisco, Davis, Irvine, University of Southern California) and Emory University. Clinical data from patients enrolled at each Center are collected at the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and DNA and cell lines have been collected at the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD).

#data

The <a href = 'https://www.alz.washington.edu'>National Alzheimerâ€™s Coordinating Center (NACC)</a> maintains a cumulative database including clinical evaluations, neuropathology data when available, and MRI Imaging. The NACC database comprises several standardized clinical and neuropathology data sets, all of which are freely available to the research community.

A first set of genetic data has been deposited within the <a href = 'https://www.niagads.org/dataset/ng00040'>National Institute on Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS)</a> and a DNA methylation dataset including a subset of GIFT study participants is available in the <a href = 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE53740'>Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)</a>.
