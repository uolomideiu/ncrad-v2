#summary
The <a href = 'http://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/alzheimers-disease-research-centers'>Alzheimer’s Disease Researcher Centers (ADRCs)</a> are funded at major medical institutions across the United States. Researchers at these Centers are working to translate research advances into improved diagnosis and care for people with Alzheimer’s disease while focusing on the program's long-term goal—finding a way to cure and possibly prevent Alzheimer’s.

#subjects

Although each center has its own area of emphasis, a common goal of the ADRCs is to enhance research on Alzheimer’s disease by creating a network that shares new ideas and research results. The clinic-based population includes subjects with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, as well as cognitively normal subjects and those with MCI.

#data

The <a href = 'https://www.alz.washington.edu/'>National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC)</a> maintains a cumulative database including clinical evaluations, neuropathology data when available, and MRI Imaging. The NACC database comprises several standardized clinical and neuropathology data sets, all of which are freely available to the research community.

#biospecimens
DNA (genomic or cell line) <br />Plasma, serum, RNA, PBMCs, CSF from select subjects
