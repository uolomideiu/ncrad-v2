    <p>Depending on the cohort you select, you will need to submit a sample request application through different portals. For application with NCRAD, you will apply to the Biospecimen Review Committee (BRC) via the NCRAD BRC Application Form. This step ensures that your project's scope and needs are in line with the available samples.</p>
    <p>This application requires the investigator to provide information and attach files:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Basic information about the requesting investigator</li>
        <li>Investigator’s bio sketch</li>
        <li>Research strategy (four-page limit, see details in Appendix 1)</li>
        <li>Table of requested samples (see Step 1 above)</li>
        <li>Basic information about project support</li>

          content: |+
            <p>NCRAD BRC reviewers assess the application considering the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>Is there sufficient evidence supporting the likelihood of this study identifying novel findings, or of otherwise contributing important knowledge regarding disease etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis or treatment?</p></li>
              <li><p>Is the project technically feasible, and if preliminary data is provided, does the assay/platform utilized provide robust and reproducible results?</p></li>
              <li><p>Do the investigators sufficiently justify the use of the resources?</p></li>
              <li><p>Do the investigators have the expertise, personnel and institutional setting to achieve the goals of the proposal?</p></li>
              <li><p>Is the number of samples requested reasonable and sufficiently powered to achieve statistical significance for hypothesis testing and to demonstrate conservation of the resource (i.e. are the number of samples requested sufficient but not in excess of what is needed)?</p></li>

    <li>If you do not complete an application and/or your request is not approved, NCRAD can provide a letter indicating the types of samples that we bank. The letter will also state that before any samples can be distributed to you, your application must be approved by the NCRAD BRC.</li>
