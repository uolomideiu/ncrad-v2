      Effect of EPHA1 genetic variation on cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging
      biomarkers in healthy, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
      cohorts

      Ephrin type-A receptor 1 (EPHA1) (11771145) was documented to be one of
      the most strongly associated locus with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a
      recent meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies. However, its
      contribution to the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear to date. Here, we
      addressed the role of EPHA1 in AD by investigating the influence of EPHA1
      on cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in three clinical
      stages from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
      database. We did not detect significant association of EPHA1 with
      amyloid-beta deposition or tau protein. However, the A-allele in the mild
      cognitive impairment group remarkably prevented hippocampal atrophy
      (partial correlation coefficient 2.812, 95% CI 0.651 to 4.973) at two-year
      follow-up. Additionally, AD subjects with the A-allele displayed less
      atrophy and greater cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in the
      right lateral occipitotemporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation
      coefficient 540.10, 95% CI 247.26 to 832.95; CMRgl: partial correlation
      coefficient 0.056, 95% CI 0.024 to 0.087) and inferior temporal gyrus
      (volume: partial correlation coefficient 327.98, 95% CI 11.65 to 644.31;
      CMRgl: partial correlation coefficient 0.055, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.091) at
      baseline. This study suggests EPHA1 (rs11771145) interferes with the
      pathological alteration of the hippocampus and the lateral
      occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyri throughout the AD process,
      leading to a lower risk of AD. However, the limited sample size and
      follow-up as well as the diversity across ethnicities precluded
      explanation of these findings.

      Importance  Recently, a rare variant in the amyloid precursor protein gene
      (APP) was described in a population from Iceland. This variant, in which
      alanine is replaced by threonine at position 673 (A673T), appears to
      protect against late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). We evaluated the
      frequency of this variant in AD cases and cognitively normal controls to
      determine whether this variant will significantly contribute to risk
      assessment in individuals in the United States.Objective  To determine the
      frequency of the APP A673T variant in a large group of elderly cognitively
      normal controls and AD cases from the United States and in 2 case-control
      cohorts from Sweden.Design, Setting, and Participants  Case-control
      association analysis of variant APP A673T in US and Swedish white
      individuals comparing AD cases with cognitively intact elderly controls.
      Participants were ascertained at multiple university-associated medical
      centers and clinics across the United States and Sweden by study-specific
      sampling methods. They were from case-control studies, community-based
      prospective cohort studies, and studies that ascertained multiplex
      families from multiple sources.Main Outcomes and Measures  Genotypes for
      the APP A673T variant were determined using the Infinium HumanExome V1
      Beadchip (Illumina, Inc) and by TaqMan genotyping (Life
      Technologies).Results  The A673T variant genotypes were evaluated in 8943
      US AD cases, 10 480 US cognitively normal controls, 862 Swedish AD cases,
      and 707 Swedish cognitively normal controls. We identified 3 US
      individuals heterozygous for A673T, including 1 AD case (age at onset, 89
      years) and 2 controls (age at last examination, 82 and 77 years). The
      remaining US samples were homozygous for the alanine (A673) allele. In the
      Swedish samples, 3 controls were heterozygous for A673T and all AD cases
      were homozygous for the A673 allele. We also genotyped a US family
      previously reported to harbor the A673T variant and found a
      mother-daughter pair, both cognitively normal at ages 72 and 84 years,
      respectively, who were both heterozygous for A673T; however, all
      individuals with AD in the family were homozygous for A673.Conclusions and
      Relevance  The A673T variant is extremely rare in US cohorts and does not
      play a substantial role in risk for AD in this population. This variant
      may be primarily restricted to Icelandic and Scandinavian populations.

    title: Coding mutations in SORL1 and Alzheimer disease
    journal: Annals of Neurology
    volume: 77
    issue: 2
    pages: 215-227
    abstract: >-
      Objective Common single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SORL1 gene have
      been associated with late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), but causal
      variants have not been fully characterized nor has the mechanism been
      established. The study was undertaken to identify functional SORL1
      mutations in patients with LOAD.  Methods This was a family- and
      cohort-based genetic association study. Caribbean Hispanics with familial
      and sporadic LOAD and similarly aged controls were recruited from the
      United States and the Dominican Republic, and patients with sporadic
      disease of Northern European origin were recruited from Canada.
      Prioritized coding variants in SORL1 were detected by targeted
      resequencing and validated by genotyping in additional family members and
      unrelated healthy controls. Variants transfected into human embryonic
      kidney 293 cell lines were tested for Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion, and the
      amount of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) secreted at the cell surface
      was determined.  Results Seventeen coding exonic variants were
      significantly associated with disease. Two rare variants
      (rs117260922-E270K and rs143571823-T947M) with minor allele frequency
      (MAF) &#60; 1% and 1 common variant (rs2298813-A528T) with MAF = 14.9%
      segregated within families and were deemed deleterious to the coding
      protein. Transfected cell lines showed increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion
      for the rare variants (E270K and T947M) and increased Aβ42 secretion for
      the common variant (A528T). All mutants increased the amount of APP at the
      cell surface, although in slightly different ways, thereby failing to
      direct full-length APP into the retromer-recycling endosome pathway. 
      Interpretation Common and rare variants in SORL1 elevate the risk of LOAD
      by directly affecting APP processing, which in turn can result in
      increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion. Ann Neurol 2015;77:215–227

      An Integrated Bioinformatics Approach for Identifying Genetic Markers that
      Predict Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker p-tau181/Abeta1-42 Ratio in
      APOE4-Negative Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients
    journal: J Alzheimers Dis
    volume: 26

    pages: 26
    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with no
      disease-modifying treatment yet available. Early detection of patients at
      risk of developing AD is of central importance. Blood-based genetic
      signatures can serve as early detection and as population-based screening
      tools. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic markers and gene
      signatures associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers levels of
      t-tau, p-tau181, and with the two ratios t-tau/Abeta1-42 and
      p-tau181/Abeta1-42 in the context of progression from mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) to AD, and to identify a panel of genetic markers that
      can predict CSF biomarker p-tau181/Abeta1-42 ratio with consideration of
      APOE4 stratification. We analyzed genome-wide the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative dataset with up to 48 months follow-up. In the
      first part of the analysis, the main effect of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) under an additive genetic model was assessed for each
      of the four CSF biomarkers. In the second part of the analysis, we
      performed an integrated analysis of genome-wide association study results
      with pathway enrichment analysis, predictive modeling and network analysis
      in the subgroup of APOE4-negative subjects. We identified a panel of five
      SNPs, rs6766238, rs1143960, rs1249963, rs11975968, and rs4836493, that are
      predictive for p-tau181/Abeta1-42 ratio (high/low) with a sensitivity of
      66% and a specificity of 70% (AUC 0.74). These results suggest that a
      panel of SNPs is a potential prognostic biomarker in APOE4-negative MCI
      patients.

      Studying ventricular abnormalities in mild cognitive impairment with
      hyperbolic Ricci flow and tensor-based morphometry
    journal: Neuroimage
    volume: 104
    issue: ""
    pages: 42024
    abstract: >-
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between normal
      aging and dementia and people with MCI are at high risk of progression to
      dementia. MCI is attracting increasing attention, as it offers an
      opportunity to target the disease process during an early symptomatic
      stage. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures have been the
      mainstay of Alzheimer's disease (AD) imaging research, however,
      ventricular morphometry analysis remains challenging because of its
      complicated topological structure. Here we describe a novel ventricular
      morphometry system based on the hyperbolic Ricci flow method and
      tensor-based morphometry (TBM) statistics. Unlike prior ventricular
      surface parameterization methods, hyperbolic conformal parameterization is
      angle-preserving and does not have any singularities. Our system generates
      a one-to-one diffeomorphic mapping between ventricular surfaces with
      consistent boundary matching conditions. The TBM statistics encode a great
      deal of surface deformation information that could be inaccessible or
      overlooked by other methods. We applied our system to the baseline MRI
      scans of a set of MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI: 71 MCI converters vs. 62 MCI stable). Although the
      combined ventricular area and volume features did not differ between the
      two groups, our fine-grained surface analysis revealed significant
      differences in the ventricular regions close to the temporal lobe and
      posterior cingulate, structures that are affected early in AD. Significant
      correlations were also detected between ventricular morphometry,
      neuropsychological measures, and a previously described imaging index
      based on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans.
      This novel ventricular morphometry method may offer a new and more
      sensitive approach to study preclinical and early symptomatic stage AD.

      Comprehensive Gene- and Pathway-Based Analysis of Depressive Symptoms in
      Older Adults
    journal: Journal of Alzheimer's Disease
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      Depressive symptoms are common in older adults and are particularly
      prevalent in those with or at elevated risk for dementia. Although the
      heritability of depression is estimated to be substantial, single
      nucleotide polymorphism-based genome-wide association studies of
      depressive symptoms have had limited success. In this study, we PERFORMED
      genome-wide gene- and pathway-based analyses of depressive symptom burden.
      Study participants included non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects (n = 6,884)
      from three independent cohorts, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and the Indiana
      Memory and Aging Study (IMAS). Gene-based meta-analysis identified
      genome-wide significant associations (ANGPT4 and FAM110A, q-value = 0.026;
      GRM7-AS3 and LRFN5, q-value = 0.042). Pathway analysis revealed enrichment
      of association in 105 pathways, including multiple pathways related to
      ERK/MAPK signaling, GSK3 signaling in bipolar disorder, cell development,
      and immune activation and inflammation. GRM7, ANGPT4, and LRFN5 have been
      previously implicated in psychiatric disorders, including the GRM7 region
      displaying association with major depressive disorder. The ERK/MAPK
      signaling pathway is a known target of antidepressant drugs and has
      important roles in neuronal plasticity, and GSK3 signaling has been
      previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease and as a promising
      therapeutic target for depression. Our results warrant further
      investigation in independent and larger cohorts and add to the growing
      understanding of the genetics and pathobiology of depressive symptoms in
      aging and neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the genes and
      pathways demonstrating association with depressive symptoms may be
      potential therapeutic targets for these symptoms in older adults.

      We used whole-exome sequencing to identify variants other than APOE
      associated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy in amnestic mild cognitive
      impairment. An in-silico predicted missense variant in REST (rs3796529)
      was found exclusively in subjects with slow hippocampal volume loss and
      validated using unbiased whole-brain analysis and meta-analysis across 5
      independent cohorts. REST is a master regulator of neurogenesis and
      neuronal differentiation that has not been previously implicated in
      Alzheimer's disease. These findings nominate REST and its functional
      pathways as protective and illustrate the potential of combining
      next-generation sequencing with neuroimaging to discover novel disease
      mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Ann Neurol 2015;77:547–552

      Reassessment of risk genotypes (GRN, TMEM106B, and ABCC9 variants)
      associated with hippocampal sclerosis of aging pathology
    journal: J Neuropathol Exp Neurol
    volume: 74

    abstract: >-
      Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a common high-morbidity
      neurodegenerative condition in elderly persons. To understand the risk
      factors for HS-Aging, we analyzed data from the Alzheimer's Disease
      Genetics Consortium and correlated the data with clinical and pathologic
      information from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database.
      Overall, 268 research volunteers with HS-Aging and 2,957 controls were
      included; detailed neuropathologic data were available for all. The study
      focused on single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with
      HS-Aging risk: rs5848 (GRN), rs1990622 (TMEM106B), and rs704180 (ABCC9).
      Analyses of a subsample that was not previously evaluated (51 HS-Aging
      cases and 561 controls) replicated the associations of previously
      identified HS-Aging risk alleles. To test for evidence of gene-gene
      interactions and genotype-phenotype relationships, pooled data were
      analyzed. The risk for HS-Aging diagnosis associated with these genetic
      polymorphisms was not secondary to an association with either Alzheimer
      disease or dementia with Lewy body neuropathologic changes. The presence
      of multiple risk genotypes was associated with a trend for additive risk
      for HS-Aging pathology. We conclude that multiple genes play important
      roles in HS-Aging, which is a distinctive neurodegenerative disease of
      aging.

      Machine learning framework for early MRI-based Alzheimer's conversion
      prediction in MCI subjects
    journal: Neuroimage
    volume: 104
    issue: ""
    pages: 398-412
    abstract: >-
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between
      age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the
      effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients
      at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD
      conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First,
      we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using
      semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive
      measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm
      resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel
      characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows:
      1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for
      the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised
      methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects
      and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized
      logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data
      before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between AD
      and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker
      by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age
      and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying
      a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value
      of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on
      data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
      database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold
      cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
      (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from
      stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data
      together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold
      cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The
      results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested
      approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the
      MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our
      results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the
      accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.

      Antiphospholipid autoantibodies as blood biomarkers for detection of early
      stage Alzheimer’s disease
    journal: Autoimmunity

    pages: 42012
    abstract: >-
      A robust blood biomarker is urgently needed to facilitate early prognosis
      for those at risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Redox reactive
      autoantibodies (R-RAAs) represent a novel family of antibodies detectable
      only after exposure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum, plasma or
      immunoglobulin fractions to oxidizing agents. We have previously reported
      that R-RAA antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) are significantly decreased
      in the CSF and serum of AD patients compared to healthy controls (HCs).
      These studies were extended to measure R-RAA aPL in serum samples obtained
      from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Serum samples
      from the ADNI-1 diagnostic groups from participants with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI), AD and HCs were blinded for diagnosis and analyzed for
      R-RAA aPL by ELISA. Demographics, cognitive data at baseline and yearly
      follow-up were subsequently provided by ADNI after posting assay data. As
      observed in CSF, R-RAA aPL in sera from the AD diagnostic group were
      significantly reduced compared to HC. However, the sera from the MCI
      population contained significantly elevated R-RAA aPL activity relative to
      AD patient and/or HC sera. The data presented in this study indicate that
      R-RAA aPL show promise as a blood biomarker for detection of early AD, and
      warrant replication in a larger sample. Longitudinal testing of an
      individual for increases in R-RAA aPL over a previously established
      baseline may serve as a useful early sero-epidemiologic blood biomarker
      for individuals at risk for developing dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.

    title: Genetics of CD33 in Alzheimer's Disease and Acute Myeloid Leukemia
    journal: Hum Mol Genet
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      The CD33 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3865444 has been
      associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rs3865444 is in
      linkage disequilibrium with rs12459419 which has been associated with
      efficacy of an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) chemotherapeutic agent based
      on a CD33 antibody. We seek to evaluate the extent to which CD33 genetics
      in AD and AML can inform one another and advance human disease therapy. We
      have previously shown that these SNPs are associated with skipping of CD33
      exon 2 in brain mRNA. Here, we report that these CD33 SNPs are associated
      with exon 2 skipping in leukocytes from AML patients and with a novel CD33
      splice variant that retains CD33 intron 1. Each copy of the minor
      rs12459419T allele decreases prototypic full-length CD33 expression by
      about 25% and decreases the AD odds ratio by about 0.10. These results
      suggest that CD33 antagonists may be useful in reducing AD risk. CD33
      inhibitors may include humanized CD33 antibodies such as Lintuzumab which
      was safe but ineffective in AML clinical trials. Here, we report that
      Lintuzumab downregulates cell surface CD33 by 80% in phorbol-ester
      differentiated U937 cells, at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml. Overall,
      we propose a model wherein a modest effect on RNA splicing is sufficient
      to mediate the CD33 association with AD risk and suggest the potential for
      an anti-CD33 antibody as an AD-relevant pharmacologic agent.

    title: A novel Alzheimer disease locus located near the gene encoding tau protein
    journal: Mol Psychiatry
    volume: 17
    issue: 10
    pages: 23
    abstract: >-
      APOE varepsilon4, the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer
      disease (AD), may mask effects of other loci. We re-analyzed genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) data from the International Genomics of
      Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) Consortium in APOE varepsilon4+ (10 352 cases
      and 9207 controls) and APOE varepsilon4- (7184 cases and 26 968 controls)
      subgroups as well as in the total sample testing for interaction between a
      single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and APOE varepsilon4 status.
      Suggestive associations (P&#60;1 x 10-4) in stage 1 were evaluated in an
      independent sample (stage 2) containing 4203 subjects (APOE varepsilon4+:
      1250 cases and 536 controls; APOE varepsilon4-: 718 cases and 1699
      controls). Among APOE varepsilon4- subjects, novel genome-wide significant
      (GWS) association was observed with 17 SNPs (all between KANSL1 and
      LRRC37A on chromosome 17 near MAPT) in a meta-analysis of the stage 1 and
      stage 2 data sets (best SNP, rs2732703, P=5.8 x 10-9). Conditional
      analysis revealed that rs2732703 accounted for association signals in the
      entire 100-kilobase region that includes MAPT. Except for previously
      identified AD loci showing stronger association in APOE varepsilon4+
      subjects (CR1 and CLU) or APOE varepsilon4- subjects
      (MS4A6A/MS4A4A/MS4A6E), no other SNPs were significantly associated with
      AD in a specific APOE genotype subgroup. In addition, the finding in the
      stage 1 sample that AD risk is significantly influenced by the interaction
      of APOE with rs1595014 in TMEM106B (P=1.6 x 10-7) is noteworthy, because
      TMEM106B variants have previously been associated with risk of
      frontotemporal dementia. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis
      revealed that rs113986870, one of the GWS SNPs near rs2732703, is
      significantly associated with four KANSL1 probes that target transcription
      of the first translated exon and an untranslated exon in hippocampus (P1.3
      x 10-8), frontal cortex (P1.3 x 10-9) and temporal cortex (P1.2 x 10-11).
      Rs113986870 is also strongly associated with a MAPT probe that targets
      transcription of alternatively spliced exon 3 in frontal cortex (P=9.2 x
      10-6) and temporal cortex (P=2.6 x 10-6). Our APOE-stratified GWAS is the
      first to show GWS association for AD with SNPs in the chromosome 17q21.31
      region. Replication of this finding in independent samples is needed to
      verify that SNPs in this region have significantly stronger effects on AD
      risk in persons lacking APOE varepsilon4 compared with persons carrying
      this allele, and if this is found to hold, further examination of this
      region and studies aimed at deciphering the mechanism(s) are
      warranted.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 17 March 2015;

      Multiple comparison procedures for neuroimaging genomewide association
      studies

    abstract: >-
      Recent research in neuroimaging has focused on assessing associations
      between genetic variants that are measured on a genomewide scale and brain
      imaging phenotypes. A large number of works in the area apply massively
      univariate analyses on a genomewide basis to find single nucleotide
      polymorphisms that influence brain structure. In this paper, we propose
      using various dimensionality reduction methods on both brain structural
      MRI scans and genomic data, motivated by the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We also consider a new multiple
      testing adjustment method and compare it with two existing false discovery
      rate (FDR) adjustment methods. The simulation results suggest an increase
      in power for the proposed method. The real-data analysis suggests that the
      proposed procedure is able to find associations between genetic variants
      and brain volume differences that offer potentially new biological
      insights.

    title: Common genetic variants influence human subcortical brain structures
    journal: Nature
    volume: advance online publication
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      The highly complex structure of the human brain is strongly shaped by
      genetic influences1. Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical
      areas to coordinate movement2, learning, memory3 and motivation4, and
      altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease2. To
      investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these
      brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the
      volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived
      from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We
      identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the
      putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci
      with previously established influences on hippocampal volume5 and
      intracranial volume6. These variants show specific volumetric effects on
      brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The
      strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic
      locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 × 10−33;
      0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of
      the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen
      volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon
      guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants
      provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain
      development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric
      dysfunction.

      Genome-wide interaction analysis reveals replicated epistatic effects on

      Abstract The discovery of several genes that affect the risk for
      Alzheimer's disease ignited a worldwide search for single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs), common genetic variants that affect the brain.
      Genome-wide search of all possible SNP-SNP interactions is challenging and
      rarely attempted because of the complexity of conducting approximately
      1011 pairwise statistical tests. However, recent advances in machine
      learning, for example, iterative sure independence screening, make it
      possible to analyze data sets with vastly more predictors than
      observations. Using an implementation of the sure independence screening
      algorithm (called EPISIS), we performed a genome-wide interaction analysis
      testing all possible SNP-SNP interactions affecting regional brain volumes
      measured on magnetic resonance imaging and mapped using tensor-based
      morphometry. We identified a significant SNP-SNP interaction between
      rs1345203 and rs1213205 that explains 1.9% of the variance in temporal
      lobe volume. We mapped the whole brain, voxelwise effects of the
      interaction in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set

      Genetic overlap between Alzheimer/'s disease and Parkinson/'s disease at
      the MAPT locus
    journal: Mol Psychiatry
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      We investigated the genetic overlap between Alzheimer/'s disease (AD) and
      Parkinson/'s disease (PD). Using summary statistics (P-values) from large
      recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (total n=89 904
      individuals), we sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      associating with both AD and PD. We found and replicated association of
      both AD and PD with the A allele of rs393152 within the extended MAPT
      region on chromosome 17 (meta analysis P-value across five independent AD
      cohorts=1.65 [times] 10-7). In independent datasets, we found a
      dose-dependent effect of the A allele of rs393152 on intra-cerebral MAPT
      transcript levels and volume loss within the entorhinal cortex and
      hippocampus. Our findings identify the tau-associated MAPT locus as a site
      of genetic overlap between AD and PD, and extending prior work, we show
      that the MAPT region increases risk of Alzheimer/'s neurodegeneration.

      A multiancestral genome-wide exome array study of alzheimer disease,

    abstract: >-
      Importance  Previous studies have indicated a heritable component of the
      etiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD),
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).
      However, few have examined the contribution of low-frequency coding
      variants on a genome-wide level.Objective  To identify low-frequency
      coding variants that affect susceptibility to AD, FTD, and PSP.Design,
      Setting, and Participants  We used the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip array
      to genotype a large number of variants (most of which are low-frequency
      coding variants) in a cohort of patients with neurodegenerative disease
      (224 with AD, 168 with FTD, and 48 with PSP) and in 224 control
      individuals without dementia enrolled between 2005-2012 from multiple
      centers participating in the Genetic Investigation in Frontotemporal
      Dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease (GIFT) Study. An additional
      multiancestral replication cohort of 240 patients with AD and 240 controls
      without dementia was used to validate suggestive findings. Variant-level
      association testing and gene-based testing were performed.Main Outcomes
      and Measures  Statistical association of genetic variants with clinical
      diagnosis of AD, FTD, and PSP.Results  Genetic variants typed by the exome
      array explained 44%, 53%, and 57% of the total phenotypic variance of AD,
      FTD, and PSP, respectively. An association with the known AD gene ABCA7
      was replicated in several ancestries (discovery P = .0049, European
      P = .041, African American P = .043, and Asian P = .027), suggesting that
      exonic variants within this gene modify AD susceptibility. In addition, 2
      suggestive candidate genes, DYSF (P = 5.53 × 10−5) and PAXIP1
      (P = 2.26 × 10−4), were highlighted in patients with AD and differentially
      expressed in AD brain. Corroborating evidence from other exome array
      studies and gene expression data points toward potential involvement of
      these genes in the pathogenesis of AD.Conclusions and Relevance 
      Low-frequency coding variants with intermediate effect size may account
      for a significant fraction of the genetic susceptibility to AD and FTD.
      Furthermore, we found evidence that coding variants in the known
      susceptibility gene ABCA7, as well as candidate genes DYSF and PAXIP1,
      confer risk for AD.

      Mild cognitive impairment with suspected nonamyloid pathology (SNAP):
      Prediction of progression
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 84
    issue: 5
    pages: 508-15
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate predictors of
      progressive cognitive deterioration in patients with suspected
      non-Alzheimer disease pathology (SNAP) and mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI). METHODS: We measured markers of amyloid pathology (CSF beta-amyloid
      42) and neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume on MRI and cortical
      metabolism on [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET) in 201 patients with MCI
      clinically followed for up to 6 years to detect progressive cognitive
      deterioration. We categorized patients with MCI as A+/A- and N+/N- based
      on presence/absence of amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration. SNAPs were
      A-N+ cases. RESULTS: The proportion of progressors was 11% (8/41), 34%
      (14/41), 56% (19/34), and 71% (60/85) in A-N-, A+N-, SNAP, and A+N+,
      respectively; the proportion of APOE epsilon4 carriers was 29%, 70%, 31%,
      and 71%, respectively, with the SNAP group featuring a significantly
      different proportion than both A+N- and A+N+ groups (p &#60;/= 0.005).
      Hypometabolism in SNAP patients was comparable to A+N+ patients (p =
      0.154), while hippocampal atrophy was more severe in SNAP patients (p =
      0.002). Compared with A-N-, SNAP and A+N+ patients had significant risk of
      progressive cognitive deterioration (hazard ratio = 2.7 and 3.8, p = 0.016
      and p &#60; 0.001), while A+N- patients did not (hazard ratio = 1.13, p =
      0.771). In A+N- and A+N+ groups, none of the biomarkers predicted time to
      progression. In the SNAP group, lower time to progression was correlated
      with greater hypometabolism (r = 0.42, p = 0.073). CONCLUSIONS: Our
      findings support the notion that patients with SNAP MCI feature a specific
      risk progression profile.

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer disease (AD) is a heterogeneous disorder with a substantial
      genetic component. A small number of cases (ie, early-onset familial AD)
      are caused by exceedingly rare but pathogenic and highly penetrant
      mutations, while most cases (ie, late-onset AD) are caused by an
      intricate—and still only partially understood—interplay of genetic and
      nongenetic risk factors.1 The past decade has seen unprecedented progress
      in deciphering the genetic underpinnings of late-onset AD. This
      advancement was achieved mostly by the application of high-throughput
      microarray genotyping in the context of genome-wide association studies
      (GWASs) comparing the allele status at millions of different base pairs on
      increasingly large samples of affected and unaffected individuals.2 Most
      AD GWAS findings to date were made with common (ie, frequency of the minor
      allele typically &gt;5%) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) typically
      exerting small genetic effect sizes (ie, odds ratios &lt;1.3). In most
      cases, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these associations have been
      difficult to discern owing to the fact that most common SNPs are located
      in noncoding regions of the genome.

      PARK10 is a major locus for sporadic neuropathologically confirmed
      Parkinson disease
    journal: Neurology
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: To minimize pathologic heterogeneity in genetic studies of
      Parkinson disease (PD), the Autopsy-Confirmed Parkinson Disease Genetics
      Consortium conducted a genome-wide association study using both patients
      with neuropathologically confirmed PD and controls. METHODS: Four hundred
      eighty-four cases and 1,145 controls met neuropathologic diagnostic
      criteria, were genotyped, and then imputed to 3,922,209 variants for
      genome-wide association study analysis. RESULTS: A small region on
      chromosome 1 was strongly associated with PD (rs10788972; p = 6.2 x 10-8).
      The association peak lies within and very close to the maximum linkage
      peaks of 2 prior positive linkage studies defining the PARK10 locus. We
      demonstrate that rs10788972 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with
      rs914722, the single nucleotide polymorphism defining the PARK10 haplotype
      previously shown to be significantly associated with age at onset in PD.
      The region containing the PARK10 locus was significantly reduced from 10.6
      megabases to 100 kilobases and contains 4 known genes: TCEANC2, TMEM59,
      miR-4781, and LDLRAD1. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the association of a PARK10
      haplotype with the risk of developing idiopathic PD. Furthermore, we
      significantly reduce the size of the PARK10 region. None of the candidate
      genes in the new PARK10 region have been previously implicated in the
      biology of PD, suggesting new areas of potential research. This study
      strongly suggests that reducing pathologic heterogeneity may enhance the
      application of genetic association studies to PD.

      Bayesian Generalized Low Rank Regression Models for Neuroimaging
      Phenotypes and Genetic Markers
    journal: Journal of the American Statistical Association
    volume: 109
    issue: 507
    pages: 997-990
    abstract: >-
      We propose a Bayesian generalized low rank regression model (GLRR) for the
      analysis of both high-dimensional responses and covariates. This
      development is motivated by performing searches for associations between
      genetic variants and brain imaging phenotypes. GLRR integrates a low rank
      matrix to approximate the high-dimensional regression coefficient matrix
      of GLRR and a dynamic factor model to model the high-dimensional
      covariance matrix of brain imaging phenotypes. Local hypothesis testing is
      developed to identify significant covariates on high-dimensional
      responses. Posterior computation proceeds via an efficient Markov chain
      Monte Carlo algorithm. A simulation study is performed to evaluate the
      finite sample performance of GLRR and its comparison with several
      competing approaches. We apply GLRR to investigate the impact of 1,071
      SNPs on top 40 genes reported by AlzGene database on the volumes of 93
      regions of interest (ROI) obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI).

      Altered effective connectivity patterns of the default mode network in

    pages: 171-5
    abstract: >-
      The aim of this work is to investigate the differences of effective
      connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) in Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      patients and normal controls (NC). The technique of independent component
      analysis (ICA) was applied to identify DMN components and multivariate
      Granger causality analysis (mGCA) was used to explore an effective
      connectivity pattern. We found that: (i) connections in AD were decreased
      than those in NC, in terms of intensity and quantity. Posterior cingulated
      cortex (PCC) exhibited significant activity in NC as it connected with
      most of the other regions within the DMN. Besides, the PCC was the
      convergence center which only received interactions from other regions;
      (ii) right inferior temporal cortex (rITC) in the NC exhibited stronger
      interactions with other regions within the DMN compared with AD patients;
      and (iii) interactions between medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and
      bilateral inferior parietal cortex (IPC) in the NC were weaker than those
      in AD patients. These findings may implicate a brain dysfunction in AD
      patients and reveal more pathophysiological characteristics of AD.

      Integrative analysis of multi-dimensional imaging genomics data for
      Alzheimer's disease prediction
    journal: Front Aging Neurosci
    volume: 6
    issue: 260
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      In this paper, we explore the effects of integrating multi-dimensional
      imaging genomics data for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prediction using
      machine learning approaches. Precisely, we compare our three recent
      proposed feature selection methods [i.e., multiple kernel learning (MKL),
      high-order graph matching based feature selection (HGM-FS), sparse
      multimodal learning (SMML)] using four widely-used modalities [i.e.,
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET),
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and genetic modality single-nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP)]. This study demonstrates the performance of each
      method using these modalities individually or integratively, and may be
      valuable to clinical tests in practice. Our experimental results suggest
      that for AD prediction, in general, (1) in terms of accuracy, PET is the
      best modality; (2) Even though the discriminant power of genetic SNP
      features is weak, adding this modality to other modalities does help
      improve the classification accuracy; (3) HGM-FS works best among the three
      feature selection methods; (4) Some of the selected features are shared by
      all the feature selection methods, which may have high correlation with
      the disease. Using all the modalities on the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the best accuracies, described as
      (mean +/- standard deviation)%, among the three methods are (76.2 +/-
      11.3)% for AD vs. MCI, (94.8 +/- 7.3)% for AD vs. HC, (76.5 +/- 11.1)% for
      MCI vs. HC, and (71.0 +/- 8.4)% for AD vs. MCI vs. HC, respectively.

      Testing for association with multiple traits in generalized estimation
      equations, with application to neuroimaging data
    journal: Neuroimage
    volume: 96
    issue: 0
    pages: 309-325
    abstract: >-
      Abstract There is an increasing need to develop and apply powerful
      statistical tests to detect multiple traits–single locus associations, as
      arising from neuroimaging genetics and other studies. For example, in the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), in addition to
      genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thousands of
      neuroimaging and neuropsychological phenotypes as intermediate phenotypes
      for Alzheimer's disease, have been collected. Although some classic
      methods like MANOVA and newly proposed methods may be applied, they have
      their own limitations. For example, MANOVA cannot be applied to binary and
      other discrete traits. In addition, the relationships among these methods
      are not well understood. Importantly, since these tests are not data
      adaptive, depending on the unknown association patterns among multiple
      traits and between multiple traits and a locus, these tests may or may not
      be powerful. In this paper we propose a class of data-adaptive weights and
      the corresponding weighted tests in the general framework of generalized
      estimation equations (GEE). A highly adaptive test is proposed to select
      the most powerful one from this class of the weighted tests so that it can
      maintain high power across a wide range of situations. Our proposed tests
      are applicable to various types of traits with or without covariates.
      Importantly, we also analytically show relationships among some existing
      and our proposed tests, indicating that many existing tests are special
      cases of our proposed tests. Extensive simulation studies were conducted
      to compare and contrast the power properties of various existing and our
      new methods. Finally, we applied the methods to an ADNI dataset to
      illustrate the performance of the methods. We conclude with the
      recommendation for the use of the GEE-based Score test and our proposed
      adaptive test for their high and complementary performance.

      Young et al. reformulate an event-based model for the progression of
      Alzheimer's disease to make it applicable to a heterogeneous sporadic
      disease population. The enhanced model predicts the ordering of biomarker
      abnormality in sporadic Alzheimer's disease independently of clinical
      diagnoses or biomarker cut-points, and shows state-of-the-art diagnostic
      classification performance.

      Transcriptome-guided amyloid imaging genetic analysis via a novel

      MOTIVATION: Imaging genetics is an emerging field that studies the
      influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. The major
      task is to examine the association between genetic markers such as
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative traits (QTs)
      extracted from neuroimaging data. The complexity of these datasets has
      presented critical bioinformatics challenges that require new enabling
      tools. Sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) is a bi-multivariate
      technique used in imaging genetics to identify complex multi-SNP-multi-QT
      associations. However, most of the existing SCCA algorithms are designed
      using the soft thresholding method, which assumes that the input features
      are independent from one another. This assumption clearly does not hold
      for the imaging genetic data. In this article, we propose a new
      knowledge-guided SCCA algorithm (KG-SCCA) to overcome this limitation as
      well as improve learning results by incorporating valuable prior
      knowledge. RESULTS: The proposed KG-SCCA method is able to model two types
      of prior knowledge: one as a group structure (e.g. linkage disequilibrium
      blocks among SNPs) and the other as a network structure (e.g. gene
      co-expression network among brain regions). The new model incorporates
      these prior structures by introducing new regularization terms to
      encourage weight similarity between grouped or connected features. A new
      algorithm is designed to solve the KG-SCCA model without imposing the
      independence constraint on the input features. We demonstrate the
      effectiveness of our algorithm with both synthetic and real data. For real
      data, using an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort, we examine the imaging
      genetic associations between all SNPs in the APOE gene (i.e. top AD gene)
      and amyloid deposition measures among cortical regions (i.e. a major AD
      hallmark). In comparison with a widely used SCCA implementation, our
      KG-SCCA algorithm produces not only improved cross-validation performances
      but also biologically meaningful results. AVAILABILITY: Software is freely
      available on request.

      Longitudinal Analysis Is More Powerful than Cross-Sectional Analysis in
      Detecting Genetic Association with Neuroimaging Phenotypes
    journal: PLoS One
    volume: 9
    issue: 8
    pages: e102312
    abstract: >-
      Most existing genome-wide association analyses are cross-sectional,
      utilizing only phenotypic data at a single time point, e.g. baseline. On
      the other hand, longitudinal studies, such as Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), collect phenotypic information at multiple
      time points. In this article, as a case study, we conducted both
      longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of the ADNI data with several
      brain imaging (not clinical diagnosis) phenotypes, demonstrating the power
      gains of longitudinal analysis over cross-sectional analysis.
      Specifically, we scanned genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) with 56 brain-wide imaging phenotypes processed by FreeSurfer on
      638 subjects. At the genome-wide significance level () or a less stringent
      level (e.g. ), longitudinal analysis of the phenotypic data from the
      baseline to month 48 identified more SNP-phenotype associations than
      cross-sectional analysis of only the baseline data. In particular, at the
      genome-wide significance level, both SNP rs429358 in gene APOE and SNP
      rs2075650 in gene TOMM40 were confirmed to be associated with various
      imaging phenotypes in multiple regions of interests (ROIs) by both
      analyses, though longitudinal analysis detected more regional phenotypes
      associated with the two SNPs and indicated another significant SNP
      rs439401 in gene APOE. In light of the power advantage of longitudinal
      analysis, we advocate its use in current and future longitudinal
      neuroimaging studies.

      A rare mutation in UNC5C predisposes to late-onset Alzheimer's disease and
      increases neuronal cell death
    journal: Nat Med
    volume: 20
    issue: 12
    pages: 1452-1457
    abstract: >-
      We have identified a rare coding mutation, T835M (rs137875858), in the
      UNC5C netrin receptor gene that segregated with disease in an autosomal
      dominant pattern in two families enriched for late-onset Alzheimer’s
      disease and that was associated with disease across four large
      case-control cohorts (odds ratio = 2.15, Pmeta = 0.0095). T835M alters a
      conserved residue in the hinge region of UNC5C, and in vitro studies
      demonstrate that this mutation leads to increased cell death in human
      HEK293T cells and in rodent neurons. Furthermore, neurons expressing T835M
      UNC5C are more susceptible to cell death from multiple neurotoxic stimuli,
      including b-amyloid (Ab), glutamate and staurosporine. On the basis of
      these data and the enriched hippocampal expression of UNC5C in the adult
      nervous system, we propose that one possible mechanism in which T835M
      UNC5C contributes to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease is by increasing
      susceptibility to neuronal cell death, particularly in vulnerable regions
      of the Alzheimer’s disease brain.

      Effects of traumatic brain injury and posttraumatic stress disorder on
      Alzheimer's disease in veterans, using the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative
    journal: Alzheimer's & Dementia
    volume: 10
    issue: 3, Supplement
    pages: S226-S235
    abstract: >-
      Both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
      are common problems resulting from military service, and both have been
      associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia resulting
      from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other causes. This study aims to use
      imaging techniques and biomarker analysis to determine whether traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) and/or PTSD resulting from combat or other traumas
      increase the risk for AD and decrease cognitive reserve in Veteran
      subjects, after accounting for age. Using military and Department of
      Veterans Affairs records, 65 Vietnam War veterans with a history of
      moderate or severe TBI with or without PTSD, 65 with ongoing PTSD without
      TBI, and 65 control subjects are being enrolled in this study at 19 sites.
      The study aims to select subject groups that are comparable in age,
      gender, ethnicity, and education. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) or dementia are being excluded. However, a new study just beginning,
      and similar in size, will study subjects with TBI, subjects with PTSD, and
      control subjects with MCI. Baseline measurements of cognition, function,
      blood, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; magnetic resonance images
      (structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state blood-level oxygen
      dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging); and amyloid
      positron emission tomographic (PET) images with florbetapir are being
      obtained. One-year follow-up measurements will be collected for most of
      the baseline procedures, with the exception of the lumbar puncture, the
      PET imaging, and apolipoprotein E genotyping. To date, 19 subjects with
      TBI only, 46 with PTSD only, and 15 with TBI and PTSD have been recruited
      and referred to 13 clinics to undergo the study protocol. It is expected
      that cohorts will be fully recruited by October 2014. This study is a
      first step toward the design and statistical powering of an AD prevention
      trial using at-risk veterans as subjects, and provides the basis for a
      larger, more comprehensive study of dementia risk factors in veterans.

      Serum cholesterol and variant in cholesterol-related gene CETP predict
      white matter microstructure
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 35
    issue: 11
    pages: 2504-2513
    abstract: >-
      Abstract Several common genetic variants influence cholesterol levels,
      which play a key role in overall health. Myelin synthesis and maintenance
      are highly sensitive to cholesterol concentrations, and abnormal
      cholesterol levels increase the risk for various brain diseases, including
      Alzheimer's disease. We report significant associations between higher
      serum cholesterol (CHOL) and high-density lipoprotein levels and higher
      fractional anisotropy in 403 young adults (23.8 ± 2.4 years) scanned with
      diffusion imaging and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging at 4 Tesla. By
      fitting a multi-locus genetic model within white matter areas associated
      with CHOL, we found that a set of 18 cholesterol-related,
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms implicated in Alzheimer's disease risk
      predicted fractional anisotropy. We focused on the single-nucleotide
      polymorphism with the largest individual effects, CETP (rs5882), and found
      that increased G-allele dosage was associated with higher fractional
      anisotropy and lower radial and mean diffusivities in voxel-wise analyses
      of the whole brain. A follow-up analysis detected white matter
      associations with rs5882 in the opposite direction in 78 older individuals
      (74.3 ± 7.3 years). Cholesterol levels may influence white matter
      integrity, and cholesterol-related genes may exert age-dependent effects
      on the brain.

      Inbreeding among Caribbean Hispanics from the Dominican Republic and its
      effects on risk of Alzheimer disease
    journal: Genet Med
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      Background: Inbreeding can be associated with a modification of disease
      risk due to excess homozygosity of recessive alleles affecting a wide
      range of phenotypes. We estimated the inbreeding coefficient in Caribbean
      Hispanics and examined its effects on risk of late-onset Alzheimer
      disease.  Methods: The inbreeding coefficient was calculated in 3,392
      subjects (1,451 late-onset Alzheimer disease patients and 1,941
      age-matched healthy controls) of Caribbean Hispanic ancestry using 177,997
      nearly independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms from genome-wide array.
      The inbreeding coefficient was estimated using the excess homozygosity
      method with and without adjusting for admixture.  Results: The average
      inbreeding coefficient in Caribbean Hispanics without accounting for
      admixture was F = 0.018 (±0.048), suggesting a mating equivalent to that
      of second cousins or second cousins once removed. Adjusting for admixture
      from three parent populations, the average inbreeding coefficient was
      found to be 0.0034 (±0.019) or close to third-cousin mating. Inbreeding
      coefficient was a significant predictor of Alzheimer disease when age,
      sex, and APOE genotype were used as adjusting covariates (P = 0.03). 
      Conclusion: The average inbreeding coefficient of this population is
      significantly higher than that of the general Caucasian populations in
      North America. The high rate of inbreeding resulting in increased
      frequency of recessive variants is advantageous for the identification of
      rare variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease.

      Importance  Late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), defined as onset of
      symptoms after age 65 years, is the most common form of dementia. Few
      reports investigate incidence rates in large family-based studies in which
      the participants were selected for family history of LOAD.Objective  To
      determine the incidence rates of dementia and LOAD in unaffected members
      in the National Institute on Aging Genetics Initiative for Late-Onset
      Alzheimer Disease/National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NIA-AD
      FBS/NCRAD) and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer
      (EFIGA) family studies.Design, Setting, and Participants  Families with 2
      or more affected siblings who had a clinical or pathological diagnosis of
      LOAD were recruited as a part of the NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD Family Study. A
      cohort of Caribbean Hispanics with familial LOAD was recruited in a
      different study at the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer’s Disease
      and the Aging Brain in New York and from clinics in the Dominican Republic
      as part of the EFIGA study.Main Outcomes and Measures  Age-specific
      incidence rates of LOAD were estimated in the unaffected family members in
      the NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD and EFIGA data sets. We restricted analyses to
      families with follow-up and complete phenotype information, including 396
      NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD and 242 EFIGA families. Among the 943 at-risk family
      members in the NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD families, 126 (13.4%) developed dementia,
      of whom 109 (86.5%) met criteria for LOAD. Among 683 at-risk family
      members in the EFIGA families, 174 (25.5%) developed dementia during the
      study period, of whom 145 (83.3%) had LOAD.Results  The annual incidence
      rates of dementia and LOAD in the NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD families per
      person-year were 0.03 and 0.03, respectively, in participants aged 65 to
      74 years; 0.07 and 0.06, respectively, in those aged 75 to 84 years; and
      0.08 and 0.07, respectively, in those 85 years or older. Incidence rates
      in the EFIGA families were slightly higher, at 0.03 and 0.02, 0.06 and
      0.05, 0.10 and 0.08, and 0.10 and 0.07, respectively, in the same age
      groups. Contrasting these results with the population-based estimates, the
      incidence was increased by 3-fold for NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD families
      (standardized incidence ratio, 3.44) and 2-fold among the EFIGA compared
      with the NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD families (1.71).Conclusions and Relevance  The
      incidence rates for familial dementia and LOAD in the NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD and
      EFIGA families are significantly higher than population-based estimates.
      The incidence rates in all groups increase with age. The higher incidence
      of LOAD can be explained by segregation of Alzheimer disease–related genes
      in these families or shared environmental risks.

      The Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA)
      Consortium is a collaborative network of researchers working together on a
      range of large-scale studies that integrate data from 70 institutions
      worldwide. Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions in
      neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have analyzed
      neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects. In addition, data from 12,171
      individuals were provided by the CHARGE consortium for replication of
      findings, in a total of 24,997 subjects. By meta-analyzing results from
      many sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that affect the brain that no
      individual site could detect on its own, and that require larger numbers
      of subjects than any individual neuroimaging study has currently
      collected. ENIGMA’s first project was a genome-wide association study
      identifying common variants in the genome associated with hippocampal
      volume or intracranial volume. Continuing work is exploring genetic
      associations with subcortical volumes (ENIGMA2) and white matter
      microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI). Working groups also focus on understanding
      how schizophrenia, bipolar illness, major depression and attention
      deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain. We review the
      current progress of the ENIGMA Consortium, along with challenges and
      unexpected discoveries made on the way.

      Ordered Subset Analysis of Copy Number Variation Association with Age at

      Genetic heterogeneity is a common problem for genome-wide association
      studies of complex human diseases. Ordered-subset analysis (OSA) reduces
      genetic heterogeneity and optimizes the use of phenotypic information,
      thus improving power under some disease models. We hypothesized that in a
      genetically heterogeneous disorder such as Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      utilizing OSA by age at onset (AAO) of AD may increase the power to detect
      relevant loci. Using this approach, 8 loci were detected, including the
      chr15 : 30,44 region harboring CHRFAM7A. The association was replicated in
      the NIA-AD FBS Familial Study dataset. CHRFAM7A is a dominant negative
      regulator of CHRNA7 function, the receptor that facilitates amyloid-β 1-42
      internalization through endocytosis and has been implicated in AD. OSA,
      using AAO as a quantitative trait, optimized power and detected replicable
      signals suggesting that AD is genetically heterogeneous between AAO
      subsets.

      Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele's role as a modulator of the
      relationship between soluble plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) and fibrillar brain
      Aβ measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography
      ([(11)C]PiB PET) has not been assessed. METHODS: Ninety-six Alzheimer's
      Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with [(11)C]PiB scans and
      plasma Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 measurements at the time of PET scanning were
      included. Regional and voxelwise analyses of [(11)C]PiB data were used to
      determine the influence of APOE ε4 allele on association of plasma Aβ1-40,
      Aβ1-42, and Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42 with [(11)C]PiB uptake. RESULTS: In APOE ε4- but
      not ε4+ participants, positive relationships between plasma Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42
      and [(11)C]PiB uptake were observed. Modeling the interaction of APOE and
      plasma Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42 improved the explained variance in [(11)C]PiB binding
      compared with using APOE and plasma Aβ1-40/Aβ1-42 as separate terms.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that plasma Aβ is a potential Alzheimer's
      disease biomarker and highlight the importance of genetic variation in
      interpretation of plasma Aβ levels.

      Educational attainment and hippocampal atrophy in the Alzheimer's disease
      neuroimaging initiative cohort

      INTRODUCTION: Subjects with higher cognitive reserve (CR) may be at a
      lower risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the neural mechanisms
      underlying this are not known. Hippocampal volume loss is an early event
      in AD that triggers cognitive decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Regression
      analyses of the effects of education on MRI-measured baseline HV in 675
      subjects (201 normal, 329 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 146
      subjects with mild AD), adjusting for age, gender, APOE varepsilon4 status
      and intracranial volume (ICV). Subjects were derived from the Alzheimer's
      Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a large US national biomarker
      study. RESULTS: The association between higher education and larger HV was
      significant in AD (P=0.014) but not in cognitively normal or MCI subjects.
      In AD, HV was about 8% larger in a person with 20 years of education
      relative to someone with 6 years of education. There was also a trend for
      the interaction between education and APOE varepsilon4 to be significant
      in AD (P=0.056). CONCLUSION: A potential protective association between
      higher education and lower hippocampal atrophy in patients with AD appears
      consistent with prior epidemiologic data linking higher education levels
      with lower rates of incident dementia. Longitudinal studies are warranted
      to confirm these findings.

      Genetic influence of apolipoprotein E4 genotype on hippocampal
      morphometry: An N = 725 surface-based Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging
      initiative study
    journal: Hum Brain Mapp
    volume: 35
    issue: 8
    pages: 3903-18
    abstract: >-
      The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele is the most prevalent genetic risk
      factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hippocampal volumes are generally
      smaller in AD patients carrying the e4 allele compared to e4 noncarriers.
      Here we examined the effect of APOE e4 on hippocampal morphometry in a
      large imaging database-the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      (ADNI). We automatically segmented and constructed hippocampal surfaces
      from the baseline MR images of 725 subjects with known APOE genotype
      information including 167 with AD, 354 with mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI), and 204 normal controls. High-order correspondences between
      hippocampal surfaces were enforced across subjects with a novel inverse
      consistent surface fluid registration method. Multivariate statistics
      consisting of multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial
      distance were computed for surface deformation analysis. Using Hotelling's
      T(2) test, we found significant morphological deformation in APOE e4
      carriers relative to noncarriers in the entire cohort as well as in the
      nondemented (pooled MCI and control) subjects, affecting the left
      hippocampus more than the right, and this effect was more pronounced in e4
      homozygotes than heterozygotes. Our findings are consistent with previous
      studies that showed e4 carriers exhibit accelerated hippocampal atrophy;
      we extend these findings to a novel measure of hippocampal morphometry.
      Hippocampal morphometry has significant potential as an imaging biomarker
      of early stage AD.

      Genome-wide association study of the rate of cognitive decline in
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Alzheimer's & Dementia
    volume: 10
    issue: 1
    pages: 45-52
    abstract: >-
      Substantial interindividual variability exists in the disease trajectories
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Some decline rapidly whereas others
      decline slowly, and there are no known explanations for this variability.
      We describe the first genome-wide association study to examine rate of
      cognitive decline in a sample of AD patients with longitudinal measures of
      cognition. METHODS: The discovery sample was 303 AD cases recruited in the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the replication sample was
      323 AD cases from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging
      Project. In the discovery sample, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment
      Scale-cognitive subscale responses were tested for association with
      genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linear
      regression. We tested the 65 most significant SNPs from the discovery
      sample for association in the replication sample. RESULTS: We identified
      SNPs in the spondin 1 gene (SPON1), the minor alleles of which were
      significantly associated with a slower rate of decline (rs11023139, P =
      7.0 × 10(-11)) in the discovery sample. A SPON1 SNP 5.5 kb upstream was
      associated with decline in the replication sample (rs11606345, P = .002).
      CONCLUSION: SPON1 has not been previously associated with AD risk, but is
      plausibly related because the gene product binds to the amyloid precursor
      protein and inhibits its cleavage by β-secretase. These data suggest that
      SPON1 may be associated with the differential rate of cognitive decline in
      AD.

      The Genetics Core of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      (ADNI), formally established in 2009, aims to provide resources and
      facilitate research related to genetic predictors of multidimensional
      Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related phenotypes. Here, we provide a systematic
      review of genetic studies published between 2009 and 2012 where either
      ADNI APOE genotype or genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were used.
      We review and synthesize ADNI genetic associations with disease status or
      quantitative disease endophenotypes including structural and functional
      neuroimaging, fluid biomarker assays, and cognitive performance. We also
      discuss the diverse analytical strategies used in these studies, including
      univariate and multivariate analysis, meta-analysis, pathway analysis, and
      interaction and network analysis. Finally, we perform pathway and network
      enrichment analyses of these ADNI genetic associations to highlight key
      mechanisms that may drive disease onset and trajectory. Major ADNI
      findings included all the top 10 AD genes and several of these (e.g.,
      APOE, BIN1, CLU, CR1, and PICALM) were corroborated by ADNI imaging, fluid
      and cognitive phenotypes. ADNI imaging genetics studies discovered novel
      findings (e.g., FRMD6) that were later replicated on different data sets.
      Several other genes (e.g., APOC1, FTO, GRIN2B, MAGI2, and TOMM40) were
      associated with multiple ADNI phenotypes, warranting further investigation
      on other data sets. The broad availability and wide scope of ADNI genetic
      and phenotypic data has advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of
      AD and has nominated novel targets for future studies employing
      next-generation sequencing and convergent multi-omics approaches, and for
      clinical drug and biomarker development. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY

      BACKGROUND: Population stratification is a key concern for genetic
      association analyses. In addition, extreme homogeneity of ethnic origins
      of a population can make it difficult to interpret how genetic
      associations in that population may translate into other populations. Here
      we have evaluated the genetic substructure of samples from the Cache
      County study relative to the HapMap Reference populations and data from
      the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). RESULTS: Our
      findings show that the Cache County study is similar in ethnic diversity
      to the self-reported &#34;Whites&#34; in the ADNI sample and less
      homogenous than the HapMap CEU population. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
      the Cache County study is genetically representative of the general
      European American population in the USA and is an appropriate population
      for conducting broadly applicable genetic studies.

      To follow-up loci discovered by the International Genomics of Alzheimer/'s
      Disease Project, we attempted independent replication of 19 single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a large Spanish sample (Fundacio ACE
      data set; 1808 patients and 2564 controls). Our results corroborate
      association with four SNPs located in the genes INPP5D, MEF2C, ZCWPW1 and
      FERMT2, respectively. Of these, ZCWPW1 was the only SNP to withstand
      correction for multiple testing (P=0.000655). Furthermore, we identify
      TRIP4 (rs74615166) as a novel genome-wide significant locus for
      Alzheimer/'s disease risk (odds ratio=1.31; confidence interval 95%
      (1.19-1.44); P=9.74 [times] 10-9).

      Dopamine D2 receptors mediate the rewarding effects of many drugs of
      abuse. In humans, several polymorphisms in DRD2, the gene encoding these
      receptors, increase our genetic risk for developing addictive disorders.
      Here, we examined one of the most frequently studied candidate variant for
      addiction in DRD2 for association with brain structure. We tested whether
      this variant showed associations with regional brain volumes across two
      independent elderly cohorts, totaling 1,032 subjects. We first examined a
      large sample of 738 elderly participants with neuroimaging and genetic
      data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1). We
      hypothesized that this addiction-related polymorphism would be associated
      with structural brain differences in regions previously implicated in
      familial vulnerability for drug dependence. Then, we assessed the
      generalizability of our findings by testing this polymorphism in a
      non-overlapping replication sample of 294 elderly subjects from a
      continuation of the first ADNI project (ADNI2) to minimize the risk of
      reporting false positive results. In both cohorts, the minor
      allele-previously linked with increased risk for addiction-was associated
      with larger volumes in various brain regions implicated in reward
      processing. These findings suggest that neuroanatomical phenotypes
      associated with familial vulnerability for drug dependence may be
      partially mediated by DRD2 genotype.

      A Commonly Carried Genetic Variant in the Delta Opioid Receptor Gene,
      OPRD1, is Associated with Smaller Regional Brain Volumes: Replication in
      Elderly and Young Populations
    journal: Human brain mapping
    volume: 35
    issue: 4
    pages: 1226-1236
    abstract: >-
      Delta opioid receptors are implicated in a variety of psychiatric and
      neurological disorders. These receptors play a key role in the reinforcing
      properties of drugs of abuse, and polymorphisms in OPRD1 (the gene
      encoding delta opioid receptors) are associated with drug addiction. Delta
      opioid receptors are also involved in protecting neurons against hypoxic
      and ischemic stress. Here, we first examined a large sample of 738 elderly
      participants with neuroimaging and genetic data from the Alzheimer’s
      Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We hypothesized that common variants in
      OPRD1 would be associated with differences in brain structure,
      particularly in regions relevant to addictive and neurodegenerative
      disorders. One very common variant (rs678849) predicted differences in
      regional brain volumes. We replicated the association of this
      single-nucleotide polymorphism with regional tissue volumes in a large
      sample of young participants in the Queensland Twin Imaging study.
      Although the same allele was associated with reduced volumes in both
      cohorts, the brain regions affected differed between the two samples. In
      healthy elderly, exploratory analyses suggested that the genotype
      associated with reduced brain volumes in both cohorts may also predict
      cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurodegenerative biomarkers, but this
      requires confirmation. If opiate receptor genetic variants are related to
      individual differences in brain structure, genotyping of these variants
      may be helpful when designing clinical trials targeting delta opioid
      receptors to treat neurological disorders.

      Combined effects of Alzheimer risk variants in the CLU and ApoE genes on
      ventricular expansion patterns in the elderly
    journal: J Neurosci
    volume: 34
    issue: 19
    pages: 6537-45
    abstract: >-
      The C allele at the rs11136000 locus in the clusterin (CLU) gene is the
      third strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's
      disease (LOAD). A recent genome-wide association study of LOAD found the
      strongest evidence of association with CLU at rs1532278, in high linkage
      disequilibrium with rs11136000. Brain structure and function are related
      to the CLU risk alleles, not just in LOAD patients but also in healthy
      young adults. We tracked the volume of the lateral ventricles across
      baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up scans in a large sample of elderly
      human participants (N = 736 at baseline), from the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative, to determine whether these CLU risk variants
      predicted longitudinal ventricular expansion. The rs11136000 major C
      allele-previously linked with reduced CLU expression and with increased
      risk for dementia-predicted faster expansion, independently of dementia
      status or ApoE genotype. Further analyses revealed that the CLU and ApoE
      risk variants had combined effects on both volumetric expansion and
      lateral ventricle surface morphology. The rs1532278 locus strongly
      resembles a regulatory element. Its association with ventricular expansion
      was slightly stronger than that of rs11136000 in our analyses, suggesting
      that it may be closer to a functional variant. Clusterin affects
      inflammation, immune responses, and amyloid clearance, which in turn may
      result in neurodegeneration. Pharmaceutical agents such as valproate,
      which counteract the effects of genetically determined reduced clusterin
      expression, may help to achieve neuroprotection and contribute to the
      prevention of dementia, especially in carriers of these CLU risk variants.

      The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele is associated with ventricular
      expansion rate and surface morphology in dementia and normal aging
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 35
    issue: 6
    pages: 1309-1317
    abstract: >-
      Abstract The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (ApoE-ε4) is the strongest
      known genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease. Expansion of
      the lateral ventricles occurs with normal aging, but dementia accelerates
      this process. Brain structure and function depend on ApoE genotype not
      just for Alzheimer's disease patients but also in healthy elderly
      individuals, and even in asymptomatic young individuals. Therefore, we
      hypothesized that the ApoE-ε4 allele is associated with altered patterns
      of longitudinal ventricular expansion, in dementia and normal aging. We
      tested this hypothesis in a large sample of elderly participants, using a
      linear discriminant analysis-based approach. Carrying more ApoE-ε4 alleles
      was associated with faster ventricular expansion bilaterally and with
      regional patterns of lateral ventricle morphology at 1- and 2-year follow
      up, after controlling for sex, age, and dementia status. ApoE genotyping
      is considered critical in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease. These
      findings, combined with earlier investigations showing that ApoE is also
      directly implicated in other conditions, suggest that the selective
      enrollment of ApoE-ε4 carriers may empower clinical trials of other
      neurological disorders.

      Mitochondrial genomic variation associated with higher mitochondrial copy
      number: the Cache County Study on Memory Health and Aging
    journal: BMC Bioinformatics
    volume: 15 Suppl 7
    issue: ""
    pages: S6
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: The mitochondria are essential organelles and are the location
      of cellular respiration, which is responsible for the majority of ATP
      production. Each cell contains multiple mitochondria, and each
      mitochondrion contains multiple copies of its own circular genome. The
      ratio of mitochondrial genomes to nuclear genomes is referred to as
      mitochondrial copy number. Decreases in mitochondrial copy number are
      known to occur in many tissues as people age, and in certain diseases. The
      regulation of mitochondrial copy number by nuclear genes has been studied
      extensively. While mitochondrial variation has been associated with
      longevity and some of the diseases known to have reduced mitochondrial
      copy number, the role that the mitochondrial genome itself has in
      regulating mitochondrial copy number remains poorly understood. RESULTS:
      We analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes from 1007 individuals
      randomly selected from the Cache County Study on Memory Health and Aging
      utilizing the inferred evolutionary history of the mitochondrial
      haplotypes present in our dataset to identify sequence variation and
      mitochondrial haplotypes associated with changes in mitochondrial copy
      number. Three variants belonging to mitochondrial haplogroups U5A1 and T2
      were significantly associated with higher mitochondrial copy number in our
      dataset. CONCLUSIONS: We identified three variants associated with higher
      mitochondrial copy number and suggest several hypotheses for how these
      variants influence mitochondrial copy number by interacting with known
      regulators of mitochondrial copy number. Our results are the first to
      report sequence variation in the mitochondrial genome that causes changes
      in mitochondrial copy number. The identification of these variants that
      increase mtDNA copy number has important implications in understanding the
      pathological processes that underlie these phenotypes.

      The global prevalence of dementia is as high as 24 million, and has been
      predicted to quadruple by the year 2050. In the US alone, Alzheimer
      disease (AD) – the most frequent cause of dementia characterized by a
      progressive decline in cognitive function in particular the memory domain
      – causes estimated health-care costs of $ 172 billion per year. Key
      neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic
      extracellular amyloid plaques – often surrounded by dystrophic neurites –
      and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological changes are
      frequently accompanied by reactive microgliosis and loss of neurons, white
      matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying these
      neuropathological changes remain unclear, but are probably caused by both
      environmental and genetic factors. In this review article, we provide an
      overview of the epidemiology of AD, review the biomarkers that may be used
      for risk assessment and in diagnosis, and give suggestions for future
      research.

      Genetics of Alzheimer’s Disease in Caribbean Hispanic and African American
      Populations
    journal: Biological Psychiatry

    abstract: >-
      Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), which is characterized by
      progressive deterioration in cognition, function, and behavior, is the
      most common cause of dementia and the sixth leading cause of all deaths,
      placing a considerable burden on Western societies. Most studies aiming to
      identify genetic susceptibility factors for LOAD have focused on
      non-Hispanic white populations. This is, in part related to differences in
      linkage disequilibrium and allele frequencies between ethnic groups that
      could lead to confounding. However, in addition, non-Hispanic white
      populations are simply more widely studied. As a consequence, minorities
      are genetically underrepresented despite the fact that in several minority
      populations living in the same community as whites (including African
      American and Caribbean Hispanics), LOAD incidence is higher. This review
      summarizes the current knowledge on genetic risk factors associated with
      LOAD risk in Caribbean Hispanics and African Americans and provides
      suggestions for future research. We focus on Caribbean Hispanics and
      African Americans because they have a high LOAD incidence and a body of
      genetic studies on LOAD that is based on samples with genome-wide
      association studies data and reasonably large effect sizes to yield
      generalizable results.

      Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) and phosphorylated Tau
      at position 181 (pTau181) are biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We
      performed an analysis and meta-analysis of genome-wide association study
      data on Abeta1-42 and pTau181 in AD dementia patients followed by
      independent replication. An association was found between Abeta1-42 level
      and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in SUCLG2 (rs62256378) (P =
      2.5x10(-12)). An interaction between APOE genotype and rs62256378 was
      detected (P = 9.5 x 10(-5)), with the strongest effect being observed in
      APOE-epsilon4 noncarriers. Clinically, rs62256378 was associated with rate
      of cognitive decline in AD dementia patients (P = 3.1 x 10(-3)).
      Functional microglia experiments showed that SUCLG2 was involved in
      clearance of Abeta1-42.

      APOE and BCHE as modulators of cerebral amyloid deposition: a florbetapir
      PET genome-wide association study
    journal: Mol Psychiatry
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      Deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the cerebral cortex is thought to be a
      pivotal event in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis with a significant
      genetic contribution. Molecular imaging can provide an early noninvasive
      phenotype, but small samples have prohibited genome-wide association
      studies (GWAS) of cortical Aβ load until now. We employed florbetapir
      (18F) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess brain Aβ levels
      in vivo for 555 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI). More than six million common genetic variants were
      tested for association to quantitative global cortical Aβ load controlling
      for age, gender and diagnosis. Independent genome-wide significant
      associations were identified on chromosome 19 within APOE (apolipoprotein
      E) (rs429358, P=5.5 × 10−14) and on chromosome 3 upstream of BCHE
      (butyrylcholinesterase) (rs509208, P=2.7 × 10−8) in a region previously
      associated with serum BCHE activity. Together, these loci explained 15% of
      the variance in cortical Aβ levels in this sample (APOE 10.7%, BCHE 4.3%).
      Suggestive associations were identified within ITGA6, near EFNA5, EDIL3,
      ITGA1, PIK3R1, NFIB and ARID1B, and between NUAK1 and C12orf75. These
      results confirm the association of APOE with Aβ deposition and represent
      the largest known effect of BCHE on an AD-related phenotype. BCHE has been
      found in senile plaques and this new association of genetic variation at
      the BCHE locus with Aβ burden in humans may have implications for
      potential disease-modifying effects of BCHE-modulating agents in the AD
      spectrum.

      Accuracy of imputation to infer unobserved APOE epsilon alleles in
      genome-wide genotyping data

    volume: 22
    issue: 10
    pages: 1239-42
    abstract: >-
      Apolipoprotein E, encoded by APOE, is the main apoprotein for catabolism
      of chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein. Two common
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in APOE, rs429358 and rs7412,
      determine the three epsilon alleles that are established genetic risk
      factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebral amyloid
      angiopathy, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). These two SNPs are not
      present in most commercially available genome-wide genotyping arrays and
      cannot be inferred through imputation using HapMap reference panels.
      Therefore, these SNPs are often separately genotyped. Introduction of
      reference panels compiled from the 1000 Genomes project has made
      imputation of these variants possible. We compared the directly genotyped
      and imputed SNPs that define the APOE epsilon alleles to determine the
      accuracy of imputation for inference of unobserved epsilon alleles. We
      utilized genome-wide genotype data obtained from two cohorts of ICH and AD
      constituting subjects of European ancestry. Our data suggest that
      imputation is highly accurate, yields an acceptable proportion of missing
      data that is non-differentially distributed across case and control
      groups, and generates comparable results to genotyped data for hypothesis
      testing. Further, we explored the effect of imputation algorithm
      parameters and demonstrated that customization of these parameters yields
      an improved balance between accuracy and missing data for inferred
      genotypes.

      Genetic predisposition to increased blood cholesterol and triglyceride
      lipid levels and risk of Alzheimer disease: a mendelian randomization
      analysis
    journal: PLoS Med
    volume: 11
    issue: 9
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Although altered lipid metabolism has been extensively
      implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) through cell
      biological, epidemiological, and genetic studies, the molecular mechanisms
      linking cholesterol and AD pathology are still not well understood and
      contradictory results have been reported. We have used a Mendelian
      randomization approach to dissect the causal nature of the association
      between circulating lipid levels and late onset AD (LOAD) and test the
      hypothesis that genetically raised lipid levels increase the risk of LOAD.
      METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included 3,914 patients with LOAD, 1,675 older
      individuals without LOAD, and 4,989 individuals from the general
      population from six genome wide studies drawn from a white population
      (total n=10,578). We constructed weighted genotype risk scores (GRSs) for
      four blood lipid phenotypes (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c],
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], triglycerides, and total
      cholesterol) using well-established SNPs in 157 loci for blood lipids
      reported by Willer and colleagues (2013). Both full GRSs using all SNPs
      associated with each trait at p&#60;5x10-8 and trait specific scores using
      SNPs associated exclusively with each trait at p&#60;5 x 10-8 were
      developed. We used logistic regression to investigate whether the GRSs
      were associated with LOAD in each study and results were combined together
      by meta-analysis. We found no association between any of the full GRSs and
      LOAD (meta-analysis results: odds ratio [OR]=1.005, 95% CI 0.82-1.24, p =
      0.962 per 1 unit increase in HDL-c; OR=0.901, 95% CI 0.65-1.25, p=0.530
      per 1 unit increase in LDL-c; OR=1.104, 95% CI 0.89-1.37, p=0.362 per 1
      unit increase in triglycerides; and OR=0.954, 95% CI 0.76-1.21, p=0.688
      per 1 unit increase in total cholesterol). Results for the trait specific
      scores were similar; however, the trait specific scores explained much
      smaller phenotypic variance. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic predisposition to
      increased blood cholesterol and triglyceride lipid levels is not
      associated with elevated LOAD risk. The observed epidemiological
      associations between abnormal lipid levels and LOAD risk could therefore
      be attributed to the result of biological pleiotropy or could be secondary
      to LOAD. Limitations of this study include the small proportion of lipid
      variance explained by the GRS, biases in case-control ascertainment, and
      the limitations implicit to Mendelian randomization studies. Future
      studies should focus on larger LOAD datasets with longitudinal sampled
      peripheral lipid measures and other markers of lipid metabolism, which
      have been shown to be altered in LOAD. Please see later in the article for
      the Editors' Summary.

      Alleles that increase risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus are not associated
      with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 35
    issue: 12
    pages: 2883.e3-2883.e10
    abstract: >-
      Abstract Although epidemiological studies suggest that type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) increases the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease
      (LOAD), the biological basis of this relationship is not well understood.
      The aim of this study was to examine the genetic comorbidity between the 2
      disorders and to investigate whether genetic liability to T2DM, estimated
      by a genotype risk scores based on T2DM associated loci, is associated
      with increased risk of LOAD. This study was performed in 2 stages. In
      stage 1, we combined genotypes for the top 15 T2DM-associated
      polymorphisms drawn from approximately 3000 individuals (1349 cases and
      1351 control subjects) with extracted and/or imputed data from 6
      genome-wide studies (&gt;10,000 individuals; 4507 cases, 2183 controls,
      4989 population controls) to form a genotype risk score and examined if
      this was associated with increased LOAD risk in a combined meta-analysis.
      In stage 2, we investigated the association of LOAD with an expanded T2DM
      score made of 45 well-established variants drawn from the 6 genome-wide
      studies. Results were combined in a meta-analysis. Both stage 1 and stage
      2 T2DM risk scores were not associated with LOAD risk (odds ratio = 0.988;
      95% confidence interval, 0.972–1.004; p = 0.144 and odds ratio = 0.993;
      95% confidence interval, 0.983–1.003; p = 0.149 per allele, respectively).
      Contrary to expectation, genotype risk scores based on established T2DM
      candidates were not associated with increased risk of LOAD. The observed
      epidemiological associations between T2DM and LOAD could therefore be a
      consequence of secondary disease processes, pleiotropic mechanisms, and/or
      common environmental risk factors. Future work should focus on
      well-characterized longitudinal cohorts with extensive phenotypic and
      genetic data relevant to both LOAD and T2DM.

      Effects of genetic variation on the dynamics of neurodegeneration in
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
    volume: 7
    issue: 10
    pages: 6944121
    abstract: >-
      Although many genetic markers are identified as being associated with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), not much is known about their association with
      the structural changes that happen as the disease progresses. In this
      study, we investigate the genetic etiology of neurodegeneration in AD by
      associating genetic markers with atrophy profiles obtained using patient
      data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
      The atrophy profiles were quantified using a linear least-squares
      regression model over the span of patient enrollment, and used as imaging
      features throughout the analysis. A subset of the imaging features were
      selected for genetic association based on their ability to discriminate
      between healthy individuals and AD patients in a Support Vector Machines
      (SVM) classifier. Each imaging feature was associated with
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a linear model that included
      age and cognitive impairment scores as covariates to correct for normal
      disease progression. After false discovery rate correction, we observed 53
      significant associations between SNPs and our imaging features, including
      associations of ventricular enlargement with SNPs on estrogen receptor 1
      (ESR1) and sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 1 (SORCS1),
      hippocampal atrophy with SNPs on ESR1, and cerebral atrophy with SNPs on
      transferrin (TF) and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). This study
      provides important insights into genetic predictors of specific types of
      neurodegeneration that could potentially be used to improve the efficacy
      of treatment strategies for the disease and allow the development of
      personalized treatment plans based on each patient's unique genetic
      profile.

      Variants in PPP3R1 and MAPT are associated with more rapid functional
      decline in Alzheimer's disease: The Cache County Dementia Progression
      Study
    journal: Alzheimer's & Dementia
    volume: ""
    issue: 0
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      Background Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the gene
      encoding the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2B (PPP3R1,
      rs1868402) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, rs3785883)
      gene were recently associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau
      levels in samples from the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at
      Washington University (WU) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      (ADNI). In these same samples, these SNPs were also associated with faster
      functional decline, or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured
      by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted
      to validate the latter association in an independent, population-based
      sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression
      Study (DPS). Methods All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb ≤1
      (mild) at initial clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb
      data on at least two other time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of
      interest (rs1868402 and rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to
      estimate associations between these SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All
      analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS. Results Although we
      observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 alone and change in
      CDR-sb (P &gt; .10), there was a significant association between a
      combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the high-risk
      genotypes at both loci progressed &gt;2.9 times faster than noncarriers (P
      = .015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data
      from WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30% faster for each copy of the
      high-risk allele at rs3785883 (P = .0082) and carriers of both high-risk
      genotypes at both loci progressed 6 times faster (P &lt; .0001) than all
      others combined. Conclusions We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et
      al that specific variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with
      accelerated progression of AD. Further characterization of this
      association will provide a better understanding of how genetic factors
      influence the rate of progression of AD and could provide novel insights
      into preventative and therapeutic strategies.

      Overrepresentation of Glutamate Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease:
      Network-Based Pathway Enrichment Using Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide
      Association Studies
    journal: PLoS ONE
    volume: 9
    issue: 4

    abstract: >-
      &#60;p&#62;Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully
      identified several risk loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless,
      these loci do not explain the entire susceptibility of the disease,
      suggesting that other genetic contributions remain to be identified. Here,
      we performed a meta-analysis combining data of 4,569 individuals (2,540
      cases and 2,029 healthy controls) derived from three publicly available
      GWAS in AD and replicated a broad genomic region (&gt;248,000 bp)
      associated with the disease near the APOE/TOMM40 locus in chromosome 19.
      To detect minor effect size contributions that could help to explain the
      remaining genetic risk, we conducted network-based pathway analyses either
      by extracting gene-wise p-values (GW), defined as the single strongest
      association signal within a gene, or calculated a more stringent
      gene-based association p-value using the extended Simes (GATES) procedure.
      Comparison of these strategies revealed that ontological sub-networks
      (SNs) involved in glutamate signaling were significantly overrepresented
      in AD (p&lt;2.7×10&#60;sup&#62;−11&#60;/sup&#62;,
      p&lt;1.9×10&#60;sup&#62;−11&#60;/sup&#62;; GW and GATES, respectively).
      Notably, glutamate signaling SNs were also found to be significantly
      overrepresented (p&lt;5.1×10&#60;sup&#62;−8&#60;/sup&#62;) in the
      Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, which was used
      as a targeted replication sample. Interestingly, components of the
      glutamate signaling SNs are coordinately expressed in disease-related
      tissues, which are tightly related to known pathological hallmarks of AD.
      Our findings suggest that genetic variation within glutamate signaling
      contributes to the remaining genetic risk of AD and support the notion
      that functional biological networks should be targeted in future therapies
      aimed to prevent or treat this devastating neurological
      disorder.&#60;/p&#62;

      Cerebrospinal fluid markers including trefoil factor 3 are associated with

    abstract: >-
      We aimed to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers associated with
      neurodegeneration in individuals with and without CSF evidence of
      Alzheimer pathology. We investigated 287 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI) subjects (age=74.9+/-6.9; 22/48/30% with Alzheimer's
      disease/mild cognitive impairment/controls) with CSF multiplex analyte
      data and serial volumetric MRI. We calculated brain and hippocampal
      atrophy rates, ventricular expansion and Mini Mental State Examination
      decline. We used false discovery rate corrected regression analyses to
      assess associations between CSF variables and atrophy rates in individuals
      with and without amyloid pathology, adjusting in stages for tau, baseline
      volume, p-tau, age, sex, ApoE4 status and diagnosis. Analytes showing
      statistically significant independent relationships were entered into
      reverse stepwise analyses. Adjusting for tau, baseline volume, p-tau, age,
      sex and ApoE4, 4/83 analytes were significantly independently associated
      with brain atrophy rate, 1/83 with ventricular expansion and 2/83 with
      hippocampal atrophy. The strongest CSF predictor for the three atrophy
      measures was low trefoil factor 3 (TFF3). High cystatin C (CysC) was
      associated with higher whole brain atrophy and hippocampal atrophy rates.
      Lower levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and chromogranin A
      (CrA) were associated with higher whole brain atrophy. In exploratory
      reverse stepwise analyses, lower TFF3 was associated with higher rates of
      whole brain, hippocampal atrophy and ventricular expansion. Lower levels
      of CrA were associated with higher whole brain atrophy rate. The
      relationship between low TFF3 and increased hippocampal atrophy rate
      remained after adjustment for diagnosis. We identified a series of CSF
      markers that are independently associated with rate of neurodegeneration
      in amyloid-positive individuals. TFF3, a substrate for NOTCH processing
      may be an important biomarker of neurodegeneration across the Alzheimer
      spectrum.

      Importance  An association of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism with
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has not been established.Objective  To
      evaluate the association of clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism with
      MCI in a large population-based cohort.Design, Setting, and Participants 
      A cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted in Olmsted County,
      Minnesota. Randomly selected participants were aged 70 to 89 years on
      October 1, 2004, and were without documented prevalent dementia. A total
      of 2050 participants were evaluated and underwent in-person interview,
      neurologic evaluation, and neuropsychological testing to assess
      performance in memory, attention/executive function, and visuospatial and
      language domains. Participants were categorized by consensus as being
      cognitively normal, having MCI, or having dementia according to published
      criteria. Clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism were ascertained from a
      medical records linkage system.Main Outcomes and Measures  Association of
      clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism with MCI.Results  Among 1904
      eligible participants, the frequency of MCI was 16% in 1450 individuals
      with normal thyroid function, 17% in 313 persons with clinical
      hypothyroidism, and 18% in 141 individuals with subclinical
      hypothyroidism. After adjusting for covariates (age, educational level,
      sex, apolipoprotein E ε4, depression, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
      stroke, body mass index, and coronary artery disease) we found no
      significant association between clinical or subclinical hypothyroidism and
      MCI (odds ratio [OR], 0.99 [95% CI, 0.66-1.48] and 0.88 [0.38-2.03],
      respectively). No effect of sex interaction was seen on these effects. In
      stratified analysis, the odds of MCI with clinical and subclinical
      hypothyroidism among men was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.57-1.82) and 1.29 (0.68-2.44)
      and, among women, was 1.04 (0.66-1.66) and 0.86 (0.37-2.02),
      respectively.Conclusions and Relevance  In this population-based cohort of
      elderly people, neither clinical nor subclinical hypothyroidism was
      associated with MCI. Our findings need to be validated in a separate
      setting using the published criteria for MCI and confirmed in a
      longitudinal study.

      Absence of C9ORF72 expanded or intermediate repeats in autopsy-confirmed
      Parkinson's disease
    journal: Movement Disorders
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      Background: We have reported that intermediate repeat lengths of the
      C9ORF72 repeat are a risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD) in a
      clinically diagnosed data set. Because 10% to 25% of clinically diagnosed
      PD have different diagnoses upon autopsy, we hypothesized that this may
      reflect phenotypic heterogeneity or concomitant pathology of other
      neurodegenerative disorders. Methods: We screened 488 autopsy-confirmed PD
      cases for expansion haplotype tag rs3849942T. In 196 identified haplotype
      carriers, the C9ORF72 repeat was genotyped using the repeat-primed
      polymerase chain reaction assay. Results: No larger (intermediate or
      expanded) repeats were found in these autopsy-confirmed PD samples. This
      absence of larger repeats is significantly different from the frequency in
      clinically diagnosed datasets (P50.002). Conclusions: Our results suggest
      that expanded or intermediate C9ORF72 repeats in clinically diagnosed PD
      or parkinsonism might be an indication of heterogeneity in clinically
      diagnosed PD cases. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential
      contribution of the C9ORF72 repeat to autopsy-confirmed PD.

      Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a high-morbidity brain
      disease in the elderly but risk factors are largely unknown. We report the
      first genome-wide association study (GWAS) with HS-Aging pathology as an
      endophenotype. In collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics
      Consortium, data were analyzed from large autopsy cohorts: (#1) National
      Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC); (#2) Rush University Religious
      Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; (#3) Group Health Research
      Institute Adult Changes in Thought study; (#4) University of California at
      Irvine 90+ Study; and (#5) University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease
      Center. Altogether, 363 HS-Aging cases and 2,303 controls, all
      pathologically confirmed, provided statistical power to test for risk
      alleles with large effect size. A two-tier study design included GWAS from
      cohorts #1-3 (Stage I) to identify promising SNP candidates, followed by
      focused evaluation of particular SNPs in cohorts #4-5 (Stage II).
      Polymorphism in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9 (ABCC9)
      gene, also known as sulfonylurea receptor 2, was associated with HS-Aging
      pathology. In the meta-analyzed Stage I GWAS, ABCC9 polymorphisms yielded
      the lowest p values, and factoring in the Stage II results, the
      meta-analyzed risk SNP (rs704178:G) attained genome-wide statistical
      significance (p = 1.4 × 10(-9)), with odds ratio (OR) of 2.13 (recessive
      mode of inheritance). For SNPs previously linked to hippocampal sclerosis,
      meta-analyses of Stage I results show OR = 1.16 for rs5848 (GRN) and OR =
      1.22 rs1990622 (TMEM106B), with the risk alleles as previously described.
      Sulfonylureas, a widely prescribed drug class used to treat diabetes, also
      modify human ABCC9 protein function. A subsample of patients from the NACC
      database (n = 624) were identified who were older than age 85 at death
      with known drug history. Controlling for important confounders such as
      diabetes itself, exposure to a sulfonylurea drug was associated with risk
      for HS-Aging pathology (p = 0.03). Thus, we describe a novel and
      targetable dementia risk factor

      Large-scale meta-analysis of genome-wide association data identifies six
      new risk loci for Parkinson's disease
    journal: Nat Genet
    volume: 46

    abstract: >-
      We conducted a meta-analysis of Parkinson’s disease genome-wide
      association studies using a common set of 7,893,274 variants across 13,708
      cases and 95,282 controls. Twenty-six loci were identified as having
      genome-wide significant association; these and 6 additional previously
      reported loci were then tested in an independent set of 5,353 cases and
      5,551 controls. Of the 32 tested SNPs, 24 replicated, including 6 newly
      identified loci. Conditional analyses within loci showed that four loci,
      including GBA, GAK-DGKQ, SNCA and the HLA region, contain a secondary
      independent risk variant. In total, we identified and replicated 28
      independent risk variants for Parkinson’s disease across 24 loci. Although
      the effect of each individual locus was small, risk profile analysis
      showed substantial cumulative risk in a comparison of the highest and
      lowest quintiles of genetic risk (odds ratio (OR) = 3.31, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) = 2.55–4.30; P = 2 × 10−16). We also show six risk loci
      associated with proximal gene expression or DNA methylation.

      Effects of multiple genetic loci on age at onset in late-onset alzheimer
      disease: A genome-wide association study
    journal: JAMA Neurology
    volume: 71
    issue: 11
    pages: 1394-1404
    abstract: >-
      Importance  Because APOE locus variants contribute to risk of late-onset
      Alzheimer disease (LOAD) and to differences in age at onset (AAO), it is
      important to know whether other established LOAD risk loci also affect AAO
      in affected participants.Objectives  To investigate the effects of known
      Alzheimer disease risk loci in modifying AAO and to estimate their
      cumulative effect on AAO variation using data from genome-wide association
      studies in the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium.Design, Setting, and
      Participants  The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium comprises 14
      case-control, prospective, and family-based data sets with data on 9162
      participants of white race/ethnicity with Alzheimer disease occurring
      after age 60 years who also had complete AAO information, gathered between
      1989 and 2011 at multiple sites by participating studies. Data on
      genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms most significantly
      associated with risk at 10 confirmed LOAD loci were examined in linear
      modeling of AAO, and individual data set results were combined using a
      random-effects, inverse variance–weighted meta-analysis approach to
      determine whether they contribute to variation in AAO. Aggregate effects
      of all risk loci on AAO were examined in a burden analysis using genotype
      scores weighted by risk effect sizes.Main Outcomes and Measures  Age at
      disease onset abstracted from medical records among participants with LOAD
      diagnosed per standard criteria.Results  Analysis confirmed the
      association of APOE with earlier AAO (P = 3.3 × 10−96), with associations
      in CR1 (rs6701713, P = 7.2 × 10−4), BIN1 (rs7561528, P = 4.8 × 10−4), and
      PICALM (rs561655, P = 2.2 × 10−3) reaching statistical significance
      (P &lt; .005). Risk alleles individually reduced AAO by 3 to 6 months.
      Burden analyses demonstrated that APOE contributes to 3.7% of the
      variation in AAO (R2 = 0.256) over baseline (R2 = 0.221), whereas the
      other 9 loci together contribute to 2.2% of the variation
      (R2 = 0.242).Conclusions and Relevance  We confirmed an association of
      APOE (OMIM 107741) variants with AAO among affected participants with LOAD
      and observed novel associations of CR1 (OMIM 120620), BIN1 (OMIM 601248),
      and PICALM (OMIM 603025) with AAO. In contrast to earlier hypothetical
      modeling, we show that the combined effects of Alzheimer disease risk
      variants on AAO are on the scale of, but do not exceed, the APOE effect.
      While the aggregate effects of risk loci on AAO may be significant,
      additional genetic contributions to AAO are individually likely to be
      small.

      Gene-based GWAS and biological pathway analysis of the resilience of
      executive functioning
    journal: Brain Imaging and Behavior
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: 42013
    abstract: >-
      Resilience in executive functioning (EF) is characterized by high EF
      measured by neuropsychological test performance despite structural brain
      damage from neurodegenerative conditions. We previously reported single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide association study (GWAS) results
      for EF resilience. Here, we report gene- and pathway-based analyses of the
      same resilience phenotype, using an optimal SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel
      Association Test (SKAT) for gene-based analyses (conservative threshold
      for genome-wide significance = 0.05/18,123 = 2.8 × 10(-6)) and the
      gene-set enrichment package GSA-SNP for biological pathway analyses (False
      discovery rate (FDR) &#60; 0.05). Gene-based analyses found a genome-wide
      significant association between RNASE13 and EF resilience
      (p = 1.33 × 10(-7)). Genetic pathways involved with dendritic/neuron
      spine, presynaptic membrane, postsynaptic density, etc., were enriched
      with association to EF resilience. Although replication of these results
      is necessary, our findings indicate the potential value of gene- and
      pathway-based analyses in research on determinants of cognitive
      resilience.

      ApoE variant p.V236E is associated with markedly reduced risk of
      Alzheimer’s disease
    journal: Molecular Neurodegeneration
    volume: 9
    issue: ""
    pages: 42319
    abstract: >-
      Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer’s
      disease (LOAD) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      which show significant association at the well-known APOE locus and at
      nineteen additional loci. Among the functional, disease-associated
      variants at these loci, missense variants are particularly important
      because they can be readily investigated in model systems to search for
      novel therapeutic targets. It is now possible to perform a low-cost search
      for these “actionable” variants by genotyping the missense variants at
      known LOAD loci already cataloged on the Exome Variant Server (EVS). In
      this proof-of-principle study designed to explore the efficacy of this
      approach, we analyzed three rare EVS variants in APOE, p.L28P, p.R145C and
      p.V236E, in our case control series of 9114 subjects. p.R145C proved to be
      too rare to analyze effectively. The minor allele of p.L28P, which was in
      complete linkage disequilibrium (D’ = 1) with the far more common APOE ϵ4
      allele, showed no association with LOAD (P = 0.75) independent of the APOE
      ϵ4 allele. p.V236E was significantly associated with a marked reduction in
      risk of LOAD (P = 7.5×10(−05); OR = 0.10, 0.03 to 0.45). The minor allele
      of p.V236E, which was in complete linkage disequilibrium (D’ = 1) with the
      common APOE ϵ3 allele, identifies a novel LOAD-associated haplotype (APOE
      ϵ3b) which is associated with decreased risk of LOAD independent of the
      more abundant APOE ϵ2, ϵ3 and ϵ4 haplotypes. Follow-up studies will be
      important to confirm the significance of this association and to better
      define its odds ratio. The ApoE p.V236E substitution is the first
      disease-associated change located in the lipid-binding, C-terminal domain
      of the protein. Thus our study (i) identifies a novel APOE missense
      variant which may profitably be studied to better understand how ApoE
      function may be modified to reduce risk of LOAD and (ii) indicates that
      analysis of protein-altering variants cataloged on the EVS can be a
      cost-effective way to identify actionable functional variants at recently
      discovered LOAD loci.

    title: Factors associated with injury in REM sleep behavior disorder
    journal: Sleep Medicine
    volume: 15
    issue: 11
    pages: 1332-1338
    abstract: >-
      AbstractObjective As factors associated with injury in rapid eye movement
      (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) remain largely unknown, we aimed to
      identify such factors. Methods We surveyed consecutive idiopathic (iRBD)
      or symptomatic RBD patients seen between 2008 and 2010 regarding
      RBD-related injuries. Associations between injuries and clinical variables
      were determined with odds ratios (OR) and multiple logistic regression
      analyses. The primary outcome variables were injury and injury severity.
      Results Fifty-three patients (40%) responded. Median age was 69 years, and
      35 (73.5%) were men. Twenty-eight (55%) had iRBD. Twenty-nine (55%)
      reported injury, with 37.8% to self and 16.7% to the bed partner. 11.3%
      had marked injuries requiring medical intervention or hospitalization,
      including two (4%) subdural hematomas. iRBD diagnosis (OR = 6.8,
      p = 0.016) and dream recall (OR = 7.5, p = 0.03) were associated with
      injury; and iRBD diagnosis was independently associated with injury and
      injury severity adjusting for age, gender, DEB frequency, and duration.
      Falls (p = 0.03) were also associated with injury severity. DEB frequency
      was not associated with injury, injury severity, or falls. Conclusions
      Injuries appear to be a frequent complication of RBD, although the
      relatively low response rate in our survey could have biased results. iRBD
      patients are more likely to suffer injury – and more severe injuries –
      than symptomatic RBD patients. In addition, recall of dreams was also
      associated with injury, and dream enactment behavior (DEB)-related falls
      were associated with more severe injuries. One in nine patients suffered
      injury requiring medical intervention. The frequency of DEB did not
      predict RBD-related injuries, highlighting the importance of timely
      initiation of treatment for RBD in patients having even rare DEB episodes.
      Future prospective studies will be necessary to define predictors of
      injury in RBD.

      Association of brain amyloid-β with cerebral perfusion and structure in
      Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment
    journal: Brain
    volume: 137
    issue: ""
    pages: 1550-1561
    abstract: >-
      Patients with Alzheimer’s disease have reduced cerebral blood flow
      measured by arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging, but it is
      unclear how this is related to amyloid-b pathology. Using 182 subjects
      from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative we tested
      associations of amyloid-b with regional cerebral blood flow in healthy
      controls (n = 51), early (n = 66) and late (n = 41) mild cognitive
      impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease with dementia (n = 24). Based on the
      theory that Alzheimer’s disease starts with amyloid-b accumulation and
      progresses with symptoms and secondary pathologies in different
      trajectories, we tested if cerebral blood flow differed between
      amyloid-b-negative controls and -positive subjects in different diagnostic
      groups, and if amyloid-b had different associations with cerebral blood
      flow and grey matter volume. Global amyloid-b load was measured by
      florbetapir positron emission tomography, and regional blood flow and
      volume were measured in eight a priori defined regions of interest.
      Cerebral blood flow was reduced in patients with dementia in most brain
      regions. Higher amyloid-b load was related to lower cerebral blood flow in
      several regions, independent of diagnostic group. When comparing
      amyloid-b-positive subjects with -negative controls, we found reductions
      of cerebral blood flow in several diagnostic groups, including in
      precuneus, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (dementia), inferior parietal
      cortex (late mild cognitive impairment and dementia), and inferior
      temporal cortex (early and late mild cognitive impairment and dementia).
      The associations of amyloid-b with cerebral blood flow and volume differed
      across the disease spectrum, with high amyloid-b being associated with
      greater cerebral blood flow reduction in controls and greater volume
      reduction in late mild cognitive impairment and dementia. In addition to
      disease stage, amyloid-b pathology affects cerebral blood flow across the
      span from controls to dementia patients. Amyloid-b pathology has different
      associations with cerebral blood flow and volume, and may cause more loss
      of blood flow in early stages, whereas volume loss dominates in late
      disease stages.

      APOE ε4 Is Associated with Disproportionate Progressive Hippocampal
      Atrophy in AD
    journal: PLoS ONE
    volume: 9
    issue: 5
    pages: e97608
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether APOE ε4 carriers have higher
      hippocampal atrophy rates than non-carriers in Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls, and if so, whether higher
      hippocampal atrophy rates are still observed after adjusting for
      concurrent whole-brain atrophy rates. METHODS: MRI scans from all
      available visits in ADNI (148 AD, 307 MCI, 167 controls) were used. MCI
      subjects were divided into “progressors” (MCI-P) if diagnosed with AD
      within 36 months or “stable” (MCI-S) if a diagnosis of MCI was maintained.
      A joint multi-level mixed-effect linear regression model was used to
      analyse the effect of ε4 carrier-status on hippocampal and whole-brain
      atrophy rates, adjusting for age, gender, MMSE and brain-to-intracranial
      volume ratio. The difference in hippocampal rates between ε4 carriers and
      non-carriers after adjustment for concurrent whole-brain atrophy rate was
      then calculated. RESULTS: Mean adjusted hippocampal atrophy rates in ε4
      carriers were significantly higher in AD, MCI-P and MCI-S (p≤0.011, all
      tests) compared with ε4 non-carriers. After adjustment for whole-brain
      atrophy rate, the difference in mean adjusted hippocampal atrophy rate
      between ε4 carriers and non-carriers was reduced but remained
      statistically significant in AD and MCI-P. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      suggest that the APOE ε4 allele drives atrophy to the medial-temporal lobe
      region in AD.

    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 35
    issue: 12
    pages: 2681-2690
    abstract: >-
      A rare heterozygous TREM2 variant p.R47H (rs75932628) has been associated
      with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to
      investigate the clinical presentation, neuropsychological profile, and
      regional pattern of gray matter and white matter loss associated with the
      TREM2 variant p.R47H, and to establish which regions best differentiate
      p.R47H carriers from noncarriers in 2 sample sets (Spanish and Alzheimer's
      Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI1). This was a cross-sectional study
      including a total number of 16 TREM2 p.R47H carriers diagnosed with AD or
      mild cognitive impairment, 75 AD p.R47H noncarriers and 75 cognitively
      intact TREM2 p.R47H noncarriers. Spanish AD TREM2 p.R47H carriers showed
      apraxia (9 of 9) and psychiatric symptoms such as personality changes,
      anxiety, paranoia, or fears more frequently than in AD noncarriers
      (corrected p = 0.039). For gray matter and white matter volumetric brain
      magnetic resonance imaging voxelwise analyses, we used statistical
      parametric mapping (SPM8) based on the General Linear Model. We used 3
      different design matrices with a full factorial design. Voxel-based
      morphometry analyses were performed separately in the 2 sample sets. The
      absence of interset statistical differences allowed us to perform joint
      and conjunction analyses. Independent voxel-based morphometry analysis of
      the Spanish set as well as conjunction and joint analyses revealed
      substantial gray matter loss in orbitofrontal cortex and anterior
      cingulate cortex with relative preservation of parietal lobes in AD and/or
      mild cognitive impairment TREM2 p.R47H carriers, suggesting that TREM2
      p.R47H variant is associated with certain clinical and neuroimaging AD
      features in addition to the increased TREM2 p.R47H atrophy in temporal
      lobes as described previously. The high frequency of pathologic behavioral
      symptoms, combined with a preferential frontobasal gray matter cortical
      loss, suggests that frontobasal and temporal regions could be more
      susceptible to the deleterious biological effects of the TREM2 variant
      p.R47H.

      AbstractBackground Less is known about the genetic basis of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) in African Americans (AAs) than in non-Hispanic whites.
      Methods Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on seven AA AD cases.
      Disease association with potentially AD-related variants from WES was
      assessed in an AA discovery cohort of 422 cases and 394 controls.
      Replication was sought in an AA sample of 1037 cases and 1869 controls
      from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC). Results Forty-four
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from WES passed filtering criteria
      and were successfully genotyped. Nominally significant (P &lt; .05)
      association to AD was observed with two African-descent specific AKAP9
      SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium: rs144662445 (P = .014) and
      rs149979685 (P = .037). These associations were replicated in the ADGC
      sample (rs144662445: P = .0022, odds ratio [OR] = 2.75; rs149979685: P =
      .0022, OR = 3.61). Conclusions Because AKAP9 was not previously linked to
      AD risk, this study indicates a potential new disease mechanism.

      Association between NME8 Locus Polymorphism and Cognitive Decline,
      Cerebrospinal Fluid and Neuroimaging Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease
    journal: PLoS ONE

    issue: 12
    pages: e114777
    abstract: >-
      Recently, a large meta-analysis of five genome wide association studies
      (GWAS) identified a novel locus (rs2718058) adjacent to NME8 that played a
      preventive role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this link between
      the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2718058 and the pathology of AD
      have not been mentioned yet. Therefore, this study assessed the strength
      of association between the NME8 rs2718058 genotypes and AD-related
      measures including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta, tau, P-tau
      concentrations, neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive performance, in a
      large cohort from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
      database. We used information of a total of 719 individuals, including 211
      normal cognition (NC), 346 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 162 AD.
      Although we didn't observe a positive relationship between rs2718058 and
      AD, it was significantly associated with several AD related
      endophenotypes. Among the normal cognitively normal participants, the
      minor allele G carriers showed significantly associated with higher CDRSB
      score than A allele carriers (P = 0.021). Occipital gyrus atrophy were
      significantly associated with NME8 genotype status (P = 0.002), with A
      allele carriers has more atrophy than the minor allele G carriers in AD
      patients; lateral ventricle (both right and left) cerebral metabolic rate
      for glucose (CMRgl) were significantly associated with NME8 genotype
      (P&#60;0.05), with GA genotype had higher metabolism than GG and AA
      genotypes in MCI group; the atrophic right hippocampus in 18 months is
      significantly different between the three group, with GG and AA genotypes
      had more hippocampus atrophy than GA genotypes in the whole group.
      Together, our results are consistent with the direction of previous
      research, suggesting that NME8 rs2718058 appears to play a role in
      lowering the brain neurodegeneration.

      Allelic differences between Europeans and Chinese for CREB1 SNPs and their

    abstract: >-
      Bipolar disorder (BD) is a polygenic disorder that shares substantial
      genetic risk factors with major depressive disorder (MDD). Genetic
      analyses have reported numerous BD susceptibility genes, while some
      variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CACNA1C have
      been successfully replicated, many others have not and subsequently their
      effects on the intermediate phenotypes cannot be verified. Here, we
      studied the MDD-related gene CREB1 in a set of independent BD sample
      groups of European ancestry (a total of 64 888 subjects) and identified
      multiple SNPs significantly associated with BD (the most significant being
      SNP rs6785[A], P¼6.32 10 5, odds ratio (OR)¼1.090). Risk SNPs were then
      subjected to further analyses in healthy Europeans for intermediate
      phenotypes of BD, including hippocampal volume, hippocampal function and
      cognitive performance. Our results showed that the risk SNPs were
      significantly associated with hippocampal volume and hippocampal function,
      with the risk alleles showing a decreased hippocampal volume and
      diminished activation of the left hippocampus, adding further evidence

      HMGCR is a genetic modifier for risk, age of onset and MCI conversion to
      Alzheimer/'s disease in a three cohorts study
    journal: Mol Psychiatry
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      Several retrospective epidemiological studies report that utilization of
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors called statins
      at mid-life can reduce the risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) by as much as 70%. Conversely, the administration of these inhibitors
      in clinically diagnosed subjects with AD confers little or no benefits
      over time. Here, we investigated the association between AD and HMGCR
      rs3846662, a polymorphism known to be involved in the regulation of HMGCR
      exon 13 skipping, in a founder population and in two distinct mixed North
      American populations of converting mild cognitively impaired (MCI)
      subjects (Alzheimer/'s disease Cooperative study (ADCS) and Alzheimer/'s
      disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts). Targeting more
      specifically women, the G allele negative (G-) AD subjects exhibit delayed
      age of onset of AD (P=0.017) and significantly reduced risk of AD (OR:
      0.521; P=0.0028), matching the effect size reported by the apolipoprotein
      E type 2 variant. Stratification for APOE4 in a large sample of MCI
      patients from the ADCS cohort revealed a significant protective effect of
      G negative carriers on AD conversion 3 years after MCI diagnosis (odds
      ratio (OR): 0.554; P=0.041). Conversion rate among APOE4 carriers with the
      HMGCR/'s G negative allele was markedly reduced (from 76% to 27%) to
      levels similar to APOE4 non-carriers (27.14%), which strongly indicate
      protection. Conversion data from the independent ADNI cohort also showed
      significantly reduced MCI or AD conversion among APOE4 carriers with the
      protective A allele (P=0.005). In conclusion, HMGCR rs3846662 acts as a
      potent genetic modifier for AD risk, age of onset and conversion.

      Random Forest ensembles for detection and prediction of Alzheimer's
      disease with a good between-cohort robustness()

    abstract: >-
      Computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a rapidly
      developing field of neuroimaging with strong potential to be used in
      practice. In this context, assessment of models' robustness to noise and
      imaging protocol differences together with post-processing and tuning
      strategies are key tasks to be addressed in order to move towards
      successful clinical applications. In this study, we investigated the
      efficacy of Random Forest classifiers trained using different structural
      MRI measures, with and without neuroanatomical constraints in the
      detection and prediction of AD in terms of accuracy and between-cohort
      robustness. From The ADNI database, 185 AD, and 225 healthy controls (HC)
      were randomly split into training and testing datasets. 165 subjects with
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were distributed according to the month of
      conversion to dementia (4-year follow-up). Structural 1.5-T MRI-scans were
      processed using Freesurfer segmentation and cortical reconstruction. Using
      the resulting output, AD/HC classifiers were trained. Training included
      model tuning and performance assessment using out-of-bag estimation.
      Subsequently the classifiers were validated on the AD/HC test set and for
      the ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. Models' between-cohort
      robustness was additionally assessed using the AddNeuroMed dataset
      acquired with harmonized clinical and imaging protocols. In the ADNI set,
      the best AD/HC sensitivity/specificity (88.6%/92.0% — test set) was
      achieved by combining cortical thickness and volumetric measures. The
      Random Forest model resulted in significantly higher accuracy compared to
      the reference classifier (linear Support Vector Machine). The models
      trained using parcelled and high-dimensional (HD) input demonstrated
      equivalent performance, but the former was more effective in terms of
      computation/memory and time costs. The sensitivity/specificity for
      detecting MCI-to-AD conversion (but not AD/HC classification performance)
      was further improved from 79.5%/75%–83.3%/81.3% by a combination of
      morphometric measurements with ApoE-genotype and demographics (age, sex,
      education). When applied to the independent AddNeuroMed cohort, the best
      ADNI models produced equivalent performance without substantial accuracy
      drop, suggesting good robustness sufficient for future clinical
      implementation.

      The genetic etiology of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has proven
      complex, involving clinical and genetic heterogeneity and gene-gene
      interactions. Recent genome wide association studies in LOAD have led to
      the discovery of novel genetic risk factors; however, the investigation of
      gene-gene interactions has been limited. Conventional genetic studies
      often use binary disease status as the primary phenotype, but for complex
      brain-based diseases, neuroimaging data can serve as quantitative
      endophenotypes that correlate with disease status and closely reflect
      pathological changes. In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      cohort, we tested for association of genetic interactions with
      longitudinal MRI measurements of the inferior lateral ventricles (ILVs),
      which have repeatedly shown a relationship to LOAD status and progression.
      We performed linear regression to evaluate the ability of pathway-derived
      SNP-SNP pairs to predict the slope of change in volume of the ILVs. After
      Bonferroni correction, we identified four significant interactions in the
      right ILV (RILV) corresponding to gene-gene pairs SYNJ2-PI4KA, PARD3-MYH2,
      PDE3A-ABHD12B, and OR2L13-PRKG1 and one significant interaction in the
      left ILV (LILV) corresponding to SYNJ2-PI4KA. The SNP-SNP interaction
      corresponding to SYNJ2-PI4KA was identical in the RILV and LILV and was
      the most significant interaction in each (RILV: p = 9.13 × 10 −12 ; LILV:
      p = 8.17 × 10 −13 ). Both genes belong to the inositol phosphate signaling
      pathway which has been previously associated with neurodegeneration in AD
      and we discuss the possibility that perturbation of this pathway results
      in a down-regulation of the Akt cell survival pathway and, thereby,
      decreased neuronal survival, as reflected by increased volume of the
      ventricles.

      Gene-Based Rare Allele Analysis Identified a Risk Gene of Alzheimer’s

      Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has a strong propensity to run in families.
      However, the known risk genes excluding APOE are not clinically useful. In
      various complex diseases, gene studies have targeted rare alleles for
      unsolved heritability. Our study aims to elucidate previously unknown risk
      genes for AD by targeting rare alleles. We used data from five publicly
      available genetic studies from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI) and the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). A
      total of 4,171 cases and 9,358 controls were included. The genotype
      information of rare alleles was imputed using 1,000 genomes. We performed
      gene-based analysis of rare alleles (minor allele frequency≤3%). The
      genome-wide significance level was defined as meta P&#60;1.8×10(–6)
      (0.05/number of genes in human genome = 0.05/28,517). ZNF628, which is
      located at chromosome 19q13.42, showed a genome-wide significant
      association with AD. The association of ZNF628 with AD was not dependent
      on APOE ε4. APOE and TREM2 were also significantly associated with AD,
      although not at genome-wide significance levels. Other genes identified by
      targeting common alleles could not be replicated in our gene-based rare
      allele analysis. We identified that rare variants in ZNF628 are associated
      with AD. The protein encoded by ZNF628 is known as a transcription factor.
      Furthermore, the associations of APOE and TREM2 with AD were highly
      significant, even in gene-based rare allele analysis, which implies that
      further deep sequencing of these genes is required in AD heritability
      studies.

      Background The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 genotype has been recommended as
      a potential inclusion or exclusion criterion in targeted clinical trials
      for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) resulting
      from AD, and has been implemented in trials of immunotherapeutic agents.
      Methods We tested this recommendation with clinical trial simulations
      using participants from a meta-database of 19 studies to create trial
      samples with APOE ε4 proportions ranging from 0% (all noncarriers) to 100%
      (all carriers). For each percentage of APOE ε4 carriers, we resampled the
      database randomly for 1000 trials for each trial scenario, planning for
      18- or 24-month trials with samples from 50 to 400 patients per treatment
      or placebo group, up to 40% dropouts, and outcomes on the Alzheimer's
      Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) with effect sizes
      from 0.15 to 0.75, and calculated statistical power. Results Enrichment of
      clinical trial participants based on APOE ε4 carrier status resulted in
      minimal increases in power compared with enrolling participants with the
      APOE ε3 genotype only or enrolling patients without regard to APOE
      genotype. Increased screening requirements to enhance the sample would
      offset gains in power. Conclusions Although samples enriched for APOE ε4
      carriers in AD or MCI clinical trials showed slightly more cognitive
      impairment and greater decline using the number APOE ε4 alleles as an
      inclusion criterion most likely would not result in more efficient trials,
      and trials would take longer because fewer patients would be available.
      The APOE ε4/εX (where X = 2, 3 or 4) genotype could be useful, however, as
      an explanatory variable or covariate if warranted by a drug's action.

      Genome-Wide Association Study of CSF Levels of 59 Alzheimer's Disease
      Candidate Proteins: Significant Associations with Proteins Involved in

      &#60;title&#62;Author Summary&#60;/title&#62; &#60;p&#62;The use of
      quantitative endophenotypes from cerebrospinal fluid has led to the
      identification of several genetic variants that alter risk or rate of
      progression of Alzheimer's disease. Here we have analyzed the levels of 58
      disease-related proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid for association with
      millions of variants across the human genome. We have identified
      significant, replicable associations with 5 analytes,
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme, Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2, Chemokine
      (C-C motif) ligand 4, Interleukin 6 receptor and Matrix
      metalloproteinase-3. Our results suggest that these variants play a
      regulatory role in the respective protein levels and are relevant to the
      inflammatory and amyloid processing pathways. Variants in associated with
      ACE and those associated with MMP3 levels also show association with risk
      for Alzheimer's disease in the expected directions. These associations are
      consistent in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma and in samples with only
      cognitively normal individuals suggesting that they are relevant in the
      regulation of these protein levels beyond the context of Alzheimer's
      disease.&#60;/p&#62;

      PLXNA4 is associated with Alzheimer disease and modulates tau
      phosphorylation
    journal: Annals of Neurology

    pages: 379-392
    abstract: >-
      Objective Much of the genetic basis for Alzheimer disease (AD) is
      unexplained. We sought to identify novel AD loci using a unique
      family-based approach that can detect robust associations with infrequent
      variants (minor allele frequency &#60; 0.10). Methods We conducted a
      genome-wide association study in the Framingham Heart Study (discovery)
      and NIA-AD FBS (National Institute on Aging–Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease)
      Study (replication) family-based cohorts using an approach that accounts
      for family structure and calculates a risk score for AD as the outcome.
      Links between the most promising gene candidate and AD pathogenesis were
      explored in silico as well as experimentally in cell-based models and in
      human brain. Results Genome-wide significant association was identified
      with a PLXNA4 single nucleotide polymorphism (rs277470) located in a
      region encoding the semaphorin-3A (SEMA3A) binding domain (meta-analysis p
      value [meta-P] = 4.1 × 10−8). A test for association with the entire
      region was also significant (meta-P = 3.2 × 10−4). Transfection of SH-SY5Y
      cells or primary rat neurons with full-length PLXNA4 (TS1) increased tau
      phosphorylation with stimulated by SEMA3A. The opposite effect was
      observed when cells were transfected with shorter isoforms (TS2 and TS3).
      However, transfection of any isoform into HEK293 cells stably expressing
      amyloid β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) did not result in differential
      effects on APP processing or Aβ production. Late stage AD cases (n = 9)
      compared to controls (n = 5) had 1.9-fold increased expression of TS1 in
      cortical brain tissue (p = 1.6 × 10−4). Expression of TS1 was
      significantly correlated with the Clinical Dementia Rating score
      (ρ = 0.75, p = 2.2 × 10−4), plaque density (ρ = 0.56, p = 0.01), and Braak
      stage (ρ = 0.54, p = 0.02). Interpretation Our results indicate that
      PLXNA4 has a role in AD pathogenesis through isoform-specific effects on
      tau phosphorylation. Ann Neurol 2014;76:379–392

    title: Coding variants in TREM2 increase risk for Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Human Molecular Genetics
    volume: 23
    issue: 21
    pages: 5838-5846
    abstract: >-
      The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid 2 (TREM2) is an immune
      phagocytic receptor expressed on brain microglia known to trigger
      phagocytosis and regulate the inflammatory response. Homozygous mutations
      in TREM2 cause Nasu–Hakola disease, a rare recessive form of dementia. A
      heterozygous TREM2 variant, p.R47H, was recently shown to increase
      Alzheimer’'s disease (AD) risk. We hypothesized that if TREM2 is truly an
      AD risk gene, there would be additional rare variants in TREM2 that
      substantially affect AD risk. To test this hypothesis, we performed pooled
      sequencing of TREM2 coding regions in 2082 AD cases and 1648 cognitively
      normal elderly controls of European American descent. We identified 16
      non-synonymous variants, six of which were not identified in previous AD
      studies. Two variants, p.R47H [P = 9.17 × 10−4, odds ratio (OR) = 2.63
      (1.44–4.81)] and p.R62H [P = 2.36 × 10−4, OR = 2.36 (1.47–3.80)] were
      significantly associated with disease risk in single-variant analyses.
      Gene-based tests demonstrate variants in TREM2 are genome-wide
      significantly associated with AD [PSKAT-O = 5.37 × 10−7; OR = 2.55
      (1.80–3.67)]. The association of TREM2 variants with AD is still highly
      significant after excluding p.R47H [PSKAT-O = 7.72 × 10−5; OR = 2.47
      (1.62–3.87)], indicating that additional TREM2 variants affect AD risk.
      Genotyping in available family members of probands suggested that p.R47H
      (P = 4.65 × 10−2) and p.R62H (P = 6.87 × 10−3) were more frequently seen
      in AD cases versus controls within these families. Gel electrophoresis
      analysis confirms that at least three TREM2 transcripts are expressed in
      human brains, including one encoding a soluble form of TREM2.

      Estrogen Receptor β Variants Modify Risk for Alzheimer's Disease in a
      Multiethnic Female Cohort
    journal: Journal of Alzheimer's Disease
    volume: 40
    issue: 1
    pages: 83-93
    abstract: >-
      Background: Few studies of gene variants that affect estrogen activity
      investigate their association with age at onset of Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) in women of different ethnicities. We investigated the influence of
      ESR2 polymorphisms on age at onset of AD in a multiethnic cohort of women.
      Objectives: To determine whether gene variants would affect risk for AD
      differently in women of different population ancestries. Methods: Among
      1,686 women participating in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging
      Project (WHICAP), association with risk for AD was assessed for 20 ESR2
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using multivariate logistic
      regression, adjusting for age at time of study enrollment, presence of an
      APOE ε4 allele, years of education, and body mass index. Results:
      Increased risk for AD was associated with four ESR2 SNPs in women of
      predominantly Caucasian AIMS-defined ancestry: rs944045, rs1256062,
      rs10144225, and rs2274705 (OR range 1.6–1.9, empiric p-value range
      0.002–0.004). A separate SNP (rs10137185) was associated with decreased
      risk for AD in women who identified themselves as Black (OR 0.6, 95% CI =
      0.4–0.9). When vascular risk factors were included in the model, a
      separate SNP (rs1256059) was associated with increased risk for AD in
      women of admixed/Hispanic ancestry (OR 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1–2.4).
      Conclusions: ESR2 polymorphisms affect risk for AD in women, and risk
      alleles vary by AIMs-defined ancestry and self-identified ethnicity. These
      effects are possibly due to different linkage disequilibrium patterns or
      differences in comorbid risk factors mediating SNP effect on risk for AD
      by group.

      The rare TREM2 R47H variant exerts only a modest effect on Alzheimer
      disease risk
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 83
    issue: 15
    pages: 1353-8
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVES: Recently, 2 independent studies reported that a rare missense
      variant, rs75932628 (R47H), in exon 2 of the gene encoding the
      &#34;triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2&#34; (TREM2)
      significantly increases the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD) with an effect
      size comparable to that of the APOE epsilon4 allele. METHODS: In this
      study, we attempted to replicate the association between rs75932628 and AD
      risk by directly genotyping rs75932628 in 2 independent Caucasian family
      cohorts consisting of 927 families (with 1,777 affected and 1,235
      unaffected) and in 2 Caucasian case-control cohorts composed of 1,314
      cases and 1,609 controls. In addition, we imputed genotypes in 3
      independent Caucasian case-control cohorts containing 1,906 cases and
      1,503 controls. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the 2 family-based and the 5
      case-control cohorts yielded a p value of 0.0029, while the overall
      summary estimate (using case-control data only) resulted in an odds ratio
      of 1.67 (95% confidence interval 0.95-2.92) for the association between
      the TREM2 R47H and increased AD risk. CONCLUSIONS: While our results serve
      to confirm the association between R47H and risk of AD, the observed
      effect on risk was substantially smaller than that previously reported.

      Genetic variation modifies risk for neurodegeneration based on biomarker
      status
    journal: Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience
    volume: 6
    issue: ""
    pages: 183
    abstract: >-
      Background: While a great deal of work has gone into understanding the
      relationship between Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain atrophy,
      and disease progression, less work has attempted to investigate how
      genetic variation modifies these relationships. The goal of this study was
      two-fold. First, we sought to identify high-risk vs. low-risk individuals
      based on their CSF tau and Aβ load and characterize these individuals with
      regard to brain atrophy in an AD-relevant region of interest. Next, we
      sought to identify genetic variants that modified the relationship between
      biomarker classification and neurodegeneration. Methods: Participants were
      categorized based on established cut-points for biomarker positivity.
      Mixed model regression was used to quantify longitudinal change in the
      left inferior lateral ventricle. Interaction analyses between single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and biomarker group status were performed
      using a genome wide association study (GWAS) approach. Correction for
      multiple comparisons was performed using the Bonferroni procedure.
      Results: One intergenic SNP (rs4866650) and one SNP within the SPTLC1 gene
      (rs7849530) modified the association between amyloid positivity and
      neurodegeneration. A transcript variant of WDR11-AS1 gene (rs12261764)
      modified the association between tau positivity and neurodegeneration.
      These effects were consistent across the two sub-datasets and explained
      approximately 3% of variance in ventricular dilation. One additional SNP
      (rs6887649) modified the association between amyloid positivity and
      baseline ventricular volume, but was not observed consistently across the
      sub-datasets. Conclusions: Genetic variation modifies the association
      between AD biomarkers and neurodegeneration. Genes that regulate the
      molecular response in the brain to oxidative stress may be particularly
      relevant to neural vulnerability to the damaging effects of amyloid-β.

      Genetic modification of the relationship between phosphorylated tau and

      AbstractBackground A subset of individuals present at autopsy with the
      pathologic features of Alzheimer's disease having never manifest the
      clinical symptoms. We sought to identify genetic factors that modify the
      relationship between phosphorylated tau (PTau) and dilation of the lateral
      inferior ventricles. Methods We used data from 700 subjects enrolled in
      the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). A genome-wide
      association study approach was used to identify PTau × single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) interactions. Variance explained by these interactions
      was quantified using hierarchical linear regression. Results Five SNP ×
      PTau interactions passed a Bonferroni correction, one of which (rs4728029,
      POT1, 2.6% of variance) was consistent across ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO
      subjects. This interaction also showed a trend-level association with
      memory performance and levels of interleukin-6 receptor. Conclusions Our
      results suggest that rs4728029 modifies the relationship between PTau and
      both ventricular dilation and cognition, perhaps through an altered
      neuroinflammatory response.

      Interactions between GSK3β and amyloid genes explain variance in amyloid
      burden
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 35
    issue: 3
    pages: 460-465
    abstract: >-
      The driving theoretical framework of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been
      built around the amyloid-β (Aβ) cascade in which amyloid pathology
      precedes and drives tau pathology. Other evidence has suggested that tau
      and amyloid pathology may arise independently. Both lines of research
      suggest that there may be epistatic relationships between genes involved
      in amyloid and tau pathophysiology. In the current study, we hypothesized
      that genes coding glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and comparable tau
      kinases would modify genetic risk for amyloid plaque pathology.
      Quantitative amyloid positron emission tomography data from the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative served as the quantitative
      outcome in regression analyses, covarying for age, gender, and diagnosis.
      Three interactions reached statistical significance, all involving the
      GSK3β single nucleotide polymorphism rs334543—2 with APBB2 (rs2585590,
      rs3098914) and 1 with APP (rs457581). These interactions explained 1.2%,
      1.5%, and 1.5% of the variance in amyloid deposition respectively. Our
      results add to a growing literature on the role of GSK-3 activity in
      amyloid processing and suggest that combined variation in GSK3β and
      APP-related genes may result in increased amyloid burden.

      A combined effect of two Alzheimer's risk genes on medial temporal

    abstract: >-
      A recent history of failed clinical trials suggests that waiting until
      even the early stages of  onset of Alzheimer0 s disease may be too late
      for effective treatment, pointing to the importance  of early intervention
      in young people. Early intervention will require markers of Alzheimer0 s
      risk  that track with genotype but are capable of responding to treatment.
      Here, we sought to identify a  functional MRI signature of combined
      Alzheimer0 s risk imparted by two genetic risk factors. We used a task of 
      executive attention during fMRI in participants genotyped for two
      Alzheimer0 s risk alleles:  APOE-ε4 and CLU-C. Executive attention is a
      sensitive indicator of the progression of Alzheimer0 s  even in the early
      stages of mild cognitive impairment, but has not yet been investigated as
      a  marker of Alzheimer0 s risk in young adults. Functional MRI revealed
      that APOE-ε4 and CLU-C had an  additive effect on brain activity such that
      increased combined genetic risk was associated with  decreased brain
      activity during executive attention, including in the medial temporal
      lobe, a brain  area affected early in Alzheimer0 s pathogenesis.

      OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical, imaging, and pathologic associations
      of the cingulate island sign (CIS) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
      METHODS: We retrospectively identified and compared patients with a
      clinical diagnosis of DLB (n=39); patients with Alzheimer disease (AD)
      matched by age, sex, and education (n=39); and cognitively normal controls
      (n=78) who underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and C11 Pittsburgh
      compound B (PiB)-PET scans. Among these patients, we studied those who
      came to autopsy and underwent Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) staging
      (n=10). RESULTS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of DLB had a higher
      ratio of posterior cingulate to precuneus plus cuneus metabolism,
      cingulate island sign (CIS), on FDG-PET than patients with AD
      (p&#60;0.001), a finding independent of beta-amyloid load on PiB-PET
      (p=0.56). Patients with CIS positivity on visual assessment of FDG-PET fit
      into the group of high- or intermediate-probability DLB pathology and
      received clinical diagnosis of DLB, not AD. Higher CIS ratio correlated
      with lower Braak NFT stage (r=-0.96; p&#60;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study
      found that CIS on FDG-PET is not associated with fibrillar beta-amyloid
      deposition but indicates lower Braak NFT stage in patients with DLB.
      Identifying biomarkers that measure relative contributions of underlying
      pathologies to dementia is critical as neurotherapeutics move toward
      targeted treatments.

      Extension and refinement of the predictive value of different classes of
      markers in ADNI: Four-year follow-up data

      AbstractBackground This study examined the predictive value of different
      classes of markers in the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      to Alzheimer's disease (AD) over an extended 4-year follow-up in the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Methods MCI
      patients were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI), positron emission tomography–fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG), and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers at baseline and were followed on a
      yearly basis for 4 years to ascertain progression to AD. Logistic
      regression models were fitted in clusters, including demographics, APOE
      genotype, cognitive markers, and biomarkers (morphometric, PET-FDG, CSF,
      amyloid-β, and tau). Results The predictive model at 4 years revealed that
      two cognitive measures, an episodic memory measure and a Clock Drawing
      screening test, were the best predictors of conversion (area under the
      curve = 0.78). Conclusions This model of prediction is consistent with the
      previous model at 2 years, thus highlighting the importance of cognitive
      measures in progression from MCI to AD. Cognitive markers were more robust
      predictors than biomarkers.

      Baseline Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and the Risk of Incident Mild Cognitive
      Impairment: A Population-Based Study
    journal: American Journal of Psychiatry
    volume: 171
    issue: 5
    pages: 572-581
    abstract: >-
      ObjectiveThe authors conducted a prospective cohort study to estimate the
      risk of incident mild cognitive impairment in cognitively normal elderly
      (aged ≥70 years) individuals with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms at
      baseline. The research was conducted in the setting of the
      population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.MethodA classification of
      normal cognitive aging, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia was
      adjudicated by an expert consensus panel based on published criteria.
      Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using Cox
      proportional hazards model, with age as a time scale. Baseline
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire data were available for 1,587
      cognitively normal persons who underwent at least one follow-up
      visit.ResultsThe cohort was followed to incident mild cognitive impairment
      (N=365) or censoring variables (N=179) for a median of 5 years. Agitation
      (hazard ratio=3.06, 95% CI=1.89–4.93), apathy (hazard ratio=2.26, 95%
      CI=1.49–3.41), anxiety (hazard ratio=1.87, 95% CI=1.28–2.73), irritability
      (hazard ratio=1.84, 95% CI=1.31–2.58), and depression (hazard ratio=1.63,
      95% CI=1.23–2.16), observed initially, increased risk for later mild
      cognitive impairment. Delusion and hallucination did not. A secondary
      analysis, limited in significance by the small number of study
      participants, showed that euphoria, disinhibition, and nighttime behaviors
      were significant predictors of nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment but
      not amnestic mild cognitive impairment. By contrast, depression predicted
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio=1.74, 95% CI=1.22–2.47)
      but not nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment.ConclusionsAn increased
      incidence of mild cognitive impairment was observed in community-dwelling
      elderly adults who had nonpsychotic psychiatric symptoms at baseline.
      These baseline psychiatric symptoms were of similar or greater magnitude
      as biomarkers (genetic and structural MRI) in increasing the risk of
      incident mild cognitive impairment.

      Mild Cognitive Impairment, Incidence, Progression, and Reversion: Findings
      from a Community-Based Cohort of Elderly African Americans
    journal: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry
    volume: 22
    issue: 7
    pages: 670-681
    abstract: >-
      Objective To examine the long-term outcomes of community-based elderly
      African Americans by following their transitions from normal cognition to
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Methods Participants were
      from the community-based Indianapolis Dementia Project. A total of 4,104
      African Americans were enrolled in 1992 or 2001 and followed until 2009
      with regularly scheduled evaluation of cognitive assessment. A two-stage
      sampling was used at each evaluation to select individuals for extensive
      clinical assessment following the results of Stage 1 cognitive testing.
      Age- and gender-specific incidence, progression, and reversion rates for
      MCI were derived using the person-year method in a dynamic cohort and
      predicted probabilities from weighted multinomial logistic models of
      transitional probabilities among normal cognition, MCI, and dementia.
      Results Annual overall incidence rate for MCI was 5.6% (95% confidence
      interval [CI]: 4.6%–6.6%). Annual progression rate from MCI to dementia
      was 5.9% (95% CI: 5.3%–6.5%), and annual reversion rate from MCI to normal
      was 18.6% (95% CI: 16.7%–20.4%). Both MCI incidence rates and MCI to
      dementia progression rates increased with age, whereas reversion rates
      from MCI to normal decreased with age. Conclusion MCI progression to
      dementia was much more frequent in the older age groups than in younger
      participants where reversion to normal cognition is more common. Future
      research is needed to determine factors related to the heterogeneous
      outcomes in MCI individuals.

      AbstractObjective To describe the clinical, positron emission tomography
      (PET), pathological, and genetic findings of a large kindred with
      progressive neurodegenerative phenotypes in which the proband had
      autopsy-confirmed corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Methods Five family
      members, including the proband, were examined neurologically. Clinical
      information from the other family members was collected by questionnaires.
      Three individuals underwent PET with 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine and
      18F-fludeoxyglucose. The proband was examined post-mortem. Genetic studies
      were performed. Results The pedigree contains 64 individuals, including 8
      affected patients. The inheritance is likely autosomal dominant with
      reduced penetrance. The proband developed progressive speech and language
      difficulties at the age of 64 years. Upon examination at the age of 68
      years, she showed non-fluent aphasia, word-finding difficulties,
      circumlocution, frontal release signs, and right-sided bradykinesia,
      rigidity, and pyramidal signs. She died 5 years after disease onset. The
      neuropathology was consistent with CBD, including many cortical and
      subcortical astrocytic plaques. Other family members had progressive
      neurodegenerative phenotypes – two were diagnosed with parkinsonism and
      behavioral problems, two with parkinsonism alone, one with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis alone, one with dementia, and one with progressive gait
      and speech problems. PET on three potentially affected individuals showed
      no significant pathology. Genetic sequencing of DNA from the proband
      excluded mutations in known neurodegenerative-related genes including
      MAPT, PGRN, LRRK2, and C9ORF72. Conclusions Families with such complex
      phenotypes rarely occur. They are usually associated with MAPT mutations;
      however, in this family, MAPT mutations have been excluded, implicating
      another causative gene or genes. Further genetic studies on this family
      may eventually disclose the etiology.

      Longitudinal change in CSF biomarkers in autosomal-dominant Alzheimer
      disease
    journal: Science translational medicine
    volume: 6
    issue: 226
    pages: 226ra30-226ra30
    abstract: >-
      Clinicopathologic evidence suggests the pathology of Alzheimer disease
      (AD) begins many years prior to cognitive symptoms. Biomarkers are
      required to identify affected individuals during this asymptomatic
      (“pre-clinical”) stage to permit intervention with potential
      disease-modifying therapies designed to preserve normal brain function.
      Studies of families with autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) mutations provide a
      unique and powerful means to investigate AD biomarker changes during the
      asymptomatic period. In this biomarker study comparing cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF), plasma and in vivo amyloid imaging, cross-sectional data obtained
      at baseline in individuals from ADAD families enrolled in the Dominantly
      Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) demonstrate reduced concentrations of
      CSF amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ1–42) associated with the presence of β-amyloid
      plaques, and elevated concentrations of CSF tau, ptau181 and VILIP-1,
      markers of neurofibrillary tangles and/or neuronal injury/death, in
      asymptomatic mutation carriers 10-20 years prior to their estimated age at
      symptom onset (EAO), and prior to detection of cognitive deficits. When
      compared longitudinally, however, the concentrations of CSF biomarkers of
      neuronal injury/death within-individuals decrease after their EAO,
      suggesting a slowing of acute neurodegenerative processes with symptomatic
      disease progression. These results emphasize the importance of
      longitudinal, within-person assessment when modeling biomarker
      trajectories across the course of the disease. If corroborated, this
      pattern may influence the definition of a positive neurodegenerative
      biomarker outcome in clinical trials.

      &#60;sec&#62; &#60;title&#62;Background&#60;/title&#62;
      &#60;p&#62;Alzheimer's disease is a common debilitating dementia with
      known heritability, for which 20 late onset susceptibility loci have been
      identified, but more remain to be discovered. This study sought to
      identify new susceptibility genes, using an alternative gene-wide
      analytical approach which tests for patterns of association within genes,
      in the powerful genome-wide association dataset of the International
      Genomics of Alzheimer's Project Consortium, comprising over 7 m genotypes
      from 25,580 Alzheimer's cases and 48,466 controls.&#60;/p&#62;
      &#60;/sec&#62;&#60;sec&#62; &#60;title&#62;Principal
      Findings&#60;/title&#62; &#60;p&#62;In addition to earlier reported genes,
      we detected genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 8
      (&#60;italic&#62;TP53INP1&#60;/italic&#62;, p =
      1.4×10&#60;sup&#62;−6&#60;/sup&#62;) and 14

      Subjective cognitive complaints contribute to misdiagnosis of mild
      cognitive impairment
    journal: J Int Neuropsychol Soc

    issue: 8
    pages: 836-47
    abstract: >-
      Subjective cognitive complaints are a criterion for the diagnosis of mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI), despite their uncertain relationship to
      objective memory performance in MCI. We aimed to examine self-reported
      cognitive complaints in subgroups of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI) MCI cohort to determine whether they are a valuable
      inclusion in the diagnosis of MCI or, alternatively, if they contribute to
      misdiagnosis. Subgroups of MCI were derived using cluster analysis of
      baseline neuropsychological test data from 448 ADNI MCI participants.
      Cognitive complaints were assessed via the Everyday Cognition (ECog)
      questionnaire, and discrepancy scores were calculated between self- and
      informant-report. Cluster analysis revealed Amnestic and Mixed cognitive
      phenotypes as well as a third Cluster-Derived Normal subgroup (41.3%),
      whose neuropsychological and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease
      (AD) biomarker profiles did not differ from a &#34;robust&#34; normal
      control group. This cognitively intact phenotype of MCI participants
      overestimated their cognitive problems relative to their informant,
      whereas Amnestic MCI participants with objective memory impairment
      underestimated their cognitive problems. Underestimation of cognitive
      problems was associated with positive CSF AD biomarkers and progression to
      dementia. Overall, there was no relationship between self-reported
      cognitive complaints and objective cognitive functioning, but significant
      correlations were observed with depressive symptoms. The inclusion of
      self-reported complaints in MCI diagnostic criteria may cloud rather than
      clarify diagnosis and result in high rates of misclassification of MCI.
      Discrepancies between self- and informant-report demonstrate that
      overestimation of cognitive problems is characteristic of normal aging
      while underestimation may reflect greater risk for cognitive decline.

      Overrepresentation of Glutamate Signaling in Alzheimer's Disease:
      Network-Based Pathway Enrichment Using Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide
      Association Studies

      Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified
      several risk loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, these loci do
      not explain the entire susceptibility of the disease, suggesting that
      other genetic contributions remain to be identified. Here, we performed a
      meta-analysis combining data of 4,569 individuals (2,540 cases and 2,029
      healthy controls) derived from three publicly available GWAS in AD and
      replicated a broad genomic region (&gt;248,000 bp) associated with the
      disease near the APOE/TOMM40 locus in chromosome 19. To detect minor
      effect size contributions that could help to explain the remaining genetic
      risk, we conducted network-based pathway analyses either by extracting
      gene-wise p-values (GW), defined as the single strongest association
      signal within a gene, or calculated a more stringent gene-based
      association p-value using the extended Simes (GATES) procedure. Comparison
      of these strategies revealed that ontological sub-networks (SNs) involved
      in glutamate signaling were significantly overrepresented in AD
      (p&lt;2.7×10&#60;sup&#62;−11&#60;/sup&#62;,
      p&lt;1.9×10&#60;sup&#62;−11&#60;/sup&#62;; GW and GATES, respectively).
      Notably, glutamate signaling SNs were also found to be significantly
      overrepresented (p&lt;5.1×10&#60;sup&#62;−8&#60;/sup&#62;) in the
      Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, which was used
      as a targeted replication sample. Interestingly, components of the
      glutamate signaling SNs are coordinately expressed in disease-related
      tissues, which are tightly related to known pathological hallmarks of AD.
      Our findings suggest that genetic variation within glutamate signaling
      contributes to the remaining genetic risk of AD and support the notion
      that functional biological networks should be targeted in future therapies
      aimed to prevent or treat this devastating neurological disorder.

      Rare coding variants in the phospholipase D3 gene confer risk for
      Alzheimer/'s disease
    journal: Nature
    volume: advance online publication
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several risk
      variants for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). These common
      variantshave replicable but small effects on LOAD risk and generally do
      not have obvious functional effects. Low-frequency coding variants, not
      detected by GWAS, are predicted to include functional variants with larger
      effects on risk. To identify low-frequency coding variants with large
      effects on LOADrisk, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 14
      large LOAD families and follow-up analyses of the candidate variants in
      several large LOAD case-control data sets. A rare variant in PLD3
      (phospholipase D3; Val232Met) segregated with disease status in two
      independent families and doubled risk for Alzheimer's disease in seven
      independent case-control series with a total of more than 11,000 cases and
      controls of European descent. Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387 cases
      and controls of European descent and 302 African American cases and
      controls, with complete sequence data for PLD3, reveal that several
      variants in this gene increase risk for Alzheimer's disease in both
      populations. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain regions that are vulnerable
      to Alzheimer's disease pathology, including hippocampus and cortex, and is
      expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons from Alzheimer's
      disease brains compared to control brains. Overexpression of PLD3 leads to
      a significant decrease in intracellular amyloid-β precursor protein (APP)
      and extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40 (the 42- and 40-residue isoforms of the
      amyloid-β peptide), and knockdown of PLD3 leads to a significant increase
      in extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40. Together, our genetic and functional data
      indicate that carriers of PLD3 coding variants have a twofold increased
      risk for LOAD and that PLD3 influences APP processing. This study provides
      an example of how densely affected families may help to identify rare
      variants with large effects on risk for disease or other complex traits.

      A genome-wide association meta-analysis of plasma A[beta] peptides
      concentrations in the elderly
    journal: Mol Psychiatry
    volume: 19
    issue: 12
    pages: 1326-1335
    abstract: >-
      Amyloid beta (A[beta]) peptides are the major components of senile
      plaques, one of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD).
      However, A[beta] peptides' functions are not fully understood and seem to
      be highly pleiotropic. We hypothesized that plasma A[beta] peptides
      concentrations could be a suitable endophenotype for a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) designed to (i) identify novel genetic factors
      involved in amyloid precursor protein metabolism and (ii) highlight
      relevant A[beta]-related physiological and pathophysiological processes.
      Hence, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of four
      studies totaling 3[thinsp]528 healthy individuals of European descent and
      for whom plasma A[beta]1-40 and A[beta]1-42 peptides levels had been
      quantified. Although we did not observe any genome-wide significant locus,
      we identified 18 suggestive loci (P&#60;1 [times] 10-5).
      Enrichment-pathway analyses revealed canonical pathways mainly involved in
      neuronal functions, for example, axonal guidance signaling. We also
      assessed the biological impact of the gene most strongly associated with
      plasma A[beta]1-42 levels (cortexin 3, CTXN3) on APP metabolism in vitro
      and found that the gene protein was able to modulate A[beta]1-42
      secretion. In conclusion, our study results suggest that plasma A[beta]
      peptides levels are valid endophenotypes in GWASs and can be used to
      characterize the metabolism and functions of APP and its metabolites.

      APOE interacts with age to modify rate of decline in cognitive and brain
      changes in Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Alzheimer's & Dementia
    volume: 10
    issue: 3
    pages: 336-348
    abstract: >-
      AbstractObjective To determine (1) whether age-standardized cognitive
      declines and brain morphometric change differ between Young-Old patients
      with Alzheimer's disease (YOAD) and Very-Old patients with Alzheimer's
      disease (VOAD), and (2) whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype
      modifies these neuropsychological and morphometric changes. Methods
      Baseline and 12-month follow-up neuropsychological and morphometric
      measures were examined for healthy control subjects and patients with AD.
      The two AD groups were divided further into subgroups on the basis of the
      presence of at least one APOE ε4 allele. Results The YOAD group showed
      more severe deficits and steeper declines in cognition than the VOAD
      group. Moreover, the presence of an APOE ε4 allele had a more deleterious
      effect on the YOAD group than the VOAD group on cognition and brain
      structure both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Conclusions Results
      underscore the importance of integrating an individual's age and genetic
      susceptibility—and their interaction—when examining neuropsychological and
      neuroimaging changes in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.

    title: A Versatile Omnibus Test for Detecting Mean and Variance Heterogeneity
    journal: Genetic epidemiology
    volume: 38
    issue: 1
    pages: 51-59
    abstract: >-
      Recent research has revealed loci that display variance heterogeneity
      through various means such as biological disruption, linkage
      disequilibrium (LD), gene-by-gene (GxG), or gene-by-environment (GxE)
      interaction. We propose a versatile likelihood ratio test that allows
      joint testing for mean and variance heterogeneity (LRT(MV)) or either
      effect alone (LRT(M) or LRT(V)) in the presence of covariates. Using
      extensive simulations for our method and others we found that all
      parametric tests were sensitive to non-normality regardless of any trait
      transformations. Coupling our test with the parametric bootstrap solves
      this issue. Using simulations and empirical data from a known mean-only
      functional variant we demonstrate how linkage disequilibrium (LD) can
      produce variance-heterogeneity loci (vQTL) in a predictable fashion based
      on differential allele frequencies, high D’ and relatively low r(2)
      values. We propose that a joint test for mean and variance heterogeneity
      is more powerful than a variance only test for detecting vQTL. This takes
      advantage of loci that also have mean effects without sacrificing much
      power to detect variance only effects. We discuss using vQTL as an
      approach to detect gene-by-gene interactions and also how vQTL are related
      to relationship loci (rQTL) and how both can create prior hypothesis for
      each other and reveal the relationships between traits and possibly
      between components of a composite trait.

    title: Missense variant in TREML2 protects against Alzheimer’s Disease
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: ""
    issue: ""
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      TREM and TREM-like receptors are a structurally similar protein family
      encoded by genes clustered on chromosome 6p21.11. Recent studies have
      identified a rare coding variant (p.R47H) in TREM2 that confers a high
      risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In addition, common SNPs in this
      genomic region are associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers
      for AD and a common intergenic variant found near the TREML2 gene has been
      identified to be protective for AD. However, little is known about the
      functional variant underlying the latter association or its relationship
      with the p.R47H. Here, we report comprehensive analyses using whole-exome
      sequencing data, CSF biomarker analyses, meta-analyses (16,254 cases and
      20,052 controls) and cell-based functional studies to support the role of
      the TREML2 coding missense variant p.S144G (rs3747742) as a potential
      driver of the meta-analysis AD-associated GWAS signal. Additionally, we
      demonstrate that the protective role of TREML2 in AD is independent of the
      role of TREM2 gene as a risk factor for AD.

      disease (AD) and related dementias are a major public health challenge and

      observed for 7 genes and pathologic features of AD and related diseases.
      Twelve of the 22 genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were
      confirmed in our pathologic sample. Correlation of effect sizes for risk
      of AD dementia with effect size for hallmark pathologic features of AD
      were strongly positive and linear. Our study discovered new genetic

      Genetic variants in a ‘cAMP element binding protein’ (CREB)-dependent
      histone acetylation pathway influence memory performance in cognitively

    abstract: >-
      The molecular pathways underlying age-related memory changes remain
      unclear. There is a substantial genetic contribution to memory performance
      through life span. A recent study has implicated RbAp48, which mediates
      its effect on age-related memory decline by interacting with cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate responsive element binding protein (CREB)1 binding
      protein and influencing this histone acetylation pathway. To validate
      these findings, we tested whether genetic variants in RbAp48, CREB1, and
      CREBBP are associated with memory performance in 3 independent data sets
      consisting of 2674 cognitively healthy elderly individuals. Genetic
      variant rs2526690 in the CREBBP gene was significantly associated with
      episodic memory performance (pmeta = 3.7 × 10−4) in a multivariate model
      adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E status. Identifying genetic
      variants that modulate mechanisms of cognitive aging will allow
      identifying valid targets for therapeutic intervention.

      Importance  There are genetic influences on memory ability as we age, but
      no specific genes have been identified.Objective  To use a cognitive
      endophenotype, exceptional episodic memory (EEM) performance, derived from
      nondemented offspring from the Long Life Family Study (LLFS) to identify
      genetic variants that may be responsible for the high cognitive
      performance of LLFS participants and further replicate these variants
      using an additional 4006 nondemented individuals from 4 independent
      elderly cohorts.Design, Setting, and Participants  A total of 467 LLFS
      participants from 18 families with 2 or more offspring that exhibited
      exceptional memory performance were used for genome-wide linkage analysis.
      Adjusted multivariate linear analyses in the 40-megabase region
      encompassing the linkage peak were conducted using 4 independent
      replication data sets that included 4006 nondemented elderly individuals.
      Results of the individual replication cohorts were combined by
      meta-analysis.Main Outcome Measure  Episodic memory scores computed as the
      mean of the 2 standardized measures of Logical Memory IA and IIA.Results 
      Heritability estimates indicated a significant genetic component for EEM
      (h2 = 0.21; SE = 0.09). Genome-wide linkage analysis revealed that EEM was
      linked to the 6q24 region (maximum logarithm of odds score, 3.64).
      Association analysis in LLFS families identified single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) nominally associated with EEM in the 40-megabase
      window encompassing the linkage peak. Replication in one cohort identified
      a set of 26 SNPs associated with episodic memory (P ≤ .05). Meta-analysis
      of the 26 SNPs using the 4 independent replication cohorts found SNPs
      rs9321334 and rs6902875 to be nominally significantly associated with
      episodic memory (P = .009 and P = .013, respectively). With meta-analysis
      restricted to individuals lacking an APOE ε4 allele, SNP rs6902875 became
      statistically significant (meta-analysis, P = 6.7 × 10−5). Haplotype
      analysis incorporating the 2 SNPs flanking rs6902875 (rs9321334 and
      rs4897574) revealed that the A-A-C haplotype was significantly associated
      with episodic memory performance (P = 2.4 × 10−5). This genomic region
      harbors monooxygenase dopamine β-hydroxylase-like 1 gene (MOXD1),
      implicated in the biosynthesis of norepinephrine, which is prominently
      involved in cognitive functions.Conclusions and Relevance  The results
      provide strong evidence for potential candidate genes related to EEM on
      6q24. Identifying the genes will help in understanding the biological
      basis of memory performance and allow interventions for enhancement of
      cognitive function.

      Association of MAPT haplotypes with Alzheimer's disease risk and MAPT
      brain gene expression levels
    journal: Alzheimer's Research & Therapy
    volume: 6
    issue: 4
    pages: 39
    abstract: >-
      INTRODUCTION:MAPT encodes for tau, the predominant component of
      neurofibrillary tangles that are neuropathological hallmarks of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic association of MAPT variants with
      late-onset AD (LOAD) risk has been inconsistent, although insufficient
      power and incomplete assessment of MAPT haplotypes may account for
      this.METHODS:We examined the association of MAPT haplotypes with LOAD risk
      in more than 20,000 subjects (n-cases = 9,814, n-controls = 11,550) from
      Mayo Clinic (n-cases = 2,052, n-controls = 3,406) and the Alzheimer's
      Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC, n-cases = 7,762, n-controls = 8,144).
      We also assessed associations with brain MAPT gene expression levels
      measured in the cerebellum (n = 197) and temporal cortex (n = 202) of LOAD
      subjects. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which tag MAPT
      haplotypes with frequencies greater than 1% were
      evaluated.RESULTS:H2-haplotype tagging rs8070723-G allele associated with
      reduced risk of LOAD (odds ratio, OR = 0.90, 95% confidence interval, CI =
      0.85-0.95, p = 5.2E-05) with consistent results in the Mayo (OR = 0.81, p
      = 7.0E-04) and ADGC (OR = 0.89, p = 1.26E-04) cohorts. rs3785883-A allele
      was also nominally significantly associated with LOAD risk (OR = 1.06, 95%
      CI = 1.01-1.13, p = 0.034). Haplotype analysis revealed significant global
      association with LOAD risk in the combined cohort (p = 0.033), with
      significant association of the H2 haplotype with reduced risk of LOAD as
      expected (p = 1.53E-04) and suggestive association with additional
      haplotypes. MAPT SNPs and haplotypes also associated with brain MAPT
      levels in the cerebellum and temporal cortex of AD subjects with the
      strongest associations observed for the H2 haplotype and reduced brain
      MAPT levels (beta = -0.16 to -0.20, p = 1.0E-03 to
      3.0E-03).CONCLUSIONS:These results confirm the previously reported MAPT H2
      associations with LOAD risk in two large series, that this haplotype has
      the strongest effect on brain MAPT expression amongst those tested and
      identify additional haplotypes with suggestive associations, which require
      replication in independent series. These biologically congruent results
      provide compelling evidence to screen the MAPT region for regulatory
      variants which confer LOAD risk by influencing its brain gene expression.

      Convergent genetic and expression data implicate immunity in Alzheimer's

      AbstractBackground Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heritable with
      20 genes showing genome-wide association in the International Genomics of
      Alzheimer's Project (IGAP). To identify the biology underlying the
      disease, we extended these genetic data in a pathway analysis. Methods The
      ALIGATOR and GSEA algorithms were used in the IGAP data to identify
      associated functional pathways and correlated gene expression networks in
      human brain. Results ALIGATOR identified an excess of curated biological
      pathways showing enrichment of association. Enriched areas of biology
      included the immune response (P = 3.27 × 10−12 after multiple testing
      correction for pathways), regulation of endocytosis (P = 1.31 × 10−11),
      cholesterol transport (P = 2.96 × 10−9), and proteasome-ubiquitin activity
      (P = 1.34 × 10−6). Correlated gene expression analysis identified four
      significant network modules, all related to the immune response (corrected
      P = .002–.05). Conclusions The immune response, regulation of endocytosis,
      cholesterol transport, and protein ubiquitination represent prime targets
      for AD therapeutics.

      Frontal asymmetry in behavioral variant FTD: clinicoimaging & pathogenetic
      correlates
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 34
    issue: 2
    pages: 636-639
    abstract: >-
      We aimed to assess associations between clinical, imaging, pathological
      and genetic features and frontal lobe asymmetry in behavioral variant
      frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Volumes of the left and right
      dorsolateral, medial and orbital frontal lobes were measured in 80 bvFTD
      subjects and subjects were classified into three groups according to the
      degree of asymmetry (asymmetric left, asymmetric right, symmetric) using
      cluster analysis. The majority of subjects were symmetric (65%), with 20%
      asymmetric left and 15% asymmetric right. There were no clinical
      differences across groups, although there was a trend for greater
      behavioral dyscontrol in right asymmetric compared to left asymmetric
      subjects. More widespread atrophy involving the parietal lobe was observed
      in the symmetric group. Genetic features differed across groups with
      symmetric frontal lobes associated with C9ORF72 and tau mutations, while
      asymmetric frontal lobes were associated with progranulin mutations. These
      findings therefore suggest that neuroanatomical patterns of frontal lobe
      atrophy in bvFTD are influenced by specific gene mutations.

      The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: a review of papers
      published since its inception
    journal: Alzheimers Dement
    volume: 8
    issue: 1 Suppl
    pages: S1-68
    abstract: >-
      The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing,
      longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging,
      genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with
      early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200
      normal control subjects; $67 million funding was provided by both the
      public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13
      pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through
      the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews
      all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes
      the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have
      been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical
      tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography
      (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting;
      (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF
      biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients.
      CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by
      beta-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and
      tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy
      and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing
      rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the
      assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently,
      the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities,
      including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and
      clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of
      AD. CSF biomarkers, beta-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may
      reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even
      nonsymptomatic subjects, and are leading candidates for the detection of
      AD in its preclinical stages; (5) the improvement of clinical trial
      efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo
      imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome
      measures to reduce sample sizes. Baseline cognitive and/or MRI measures
      generally predicted future decline better than other modalities, whereas
      MRI measures of change were shown to be the most efficient outcome
      measures; (6) the confirmation of the AD risk loci CLU, CR1, and PICALM
      and the identification of novel candidate risk loci; (7) worldwide impact
      through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Europe, Asia, and
      Australia; (8) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging,
      MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker data with clinical data
      from ADNI to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about
      competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing
      efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (9) the establishment
      of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without
      embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world. The
      ADNI study was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and
      a renewal of ADNI (ADNI-2) in October 2010 through to 2016, with
      enrollment of an additional 550 participants.

      Effect of Complement CR1 on Brain Amyloid Burden During Aging and Its
      Modification by APOE Genotype
    journal: Biological Psychiatry
    volume: 73
    issue: 5
    pages: 422-428
    abstract: >-
      Background The rs3818361 single nucleotide polymorphism in complement
      component (3b/4b) receptor-1 (CR1) is associated with increased risk of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although this novel variant is associated with a
      small effect size and is unlikely to be useful as a predictor of AD risk,
      it might provide insights into AD pathogenesis. We examined the
      association between rs3818361 and brain amyloid deposition in nondemented
      older individuals.  Methods We used 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B positron
      emission tomography to quantify brain amyloid burden in 57 nondemented
      older individuals (mean age 78.5 years) in the neuroimaging substudy of
      the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. In a replication study, we
      analyzed 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography data from
      22 cognitively normal older individuals (mean age 77.1 years) in the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.  Results Risk allele
      carriers of rs3818361 have lower brain amyloid burden relative to
      noncarriers. There is a strikingly greater variability in brain amyloid
      deposition in the noncarrier group relative to risk carriers, an effect
      explained partly by APOE genotype. In noncarriers of the CR1 risk allele,
      APOE ε4 individuals showed significantly higher brain amyloid burden
      relative to APOE ε4 noncarriers. We also independently replicate our
      observation of lower brain amyloid burden in risk allele carriers of
      rs3818361 in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sample. 
      Conclusions Our findings suggest complex mechanisms underlying the
      interaction of CR1, APOE, and brain amyloid pathways in AD. Our results
      are relevant to treatments targeting brain Aβ in nondemented individuals
      at risk for AD and suggest that clinical outcomes of such treatments might
      be influenced by complex gene-gene interactions.

      Phenotypic variability in three families with valosin-containing protein
      mutation
    journal: Eur J Neurol
    volume: 20

    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The phenotype of IBMPFD [inclusion body myopathy
      with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)]
      associated with valosin-containing protein (VCP) mutation is described in
      three families. METHODS: Probands were identified based on a pathological
      diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43-positive
      inclusions type IV. VCP sequencing was carried out. Clinical data on
      affected family members were reviewed. RESULTS: Ohio family: four subjects
      presented muscle weakness and wasting. (One subject had both neuropathic
      and myopathic findings and another subject showed only evidence of
      myopathy. The etiology of weakness could not be ascertained in the
      remaining two subjects.) Two individuals also showed Parkinsonism (with
      associated FTD in one of the two). The proband's brain displayed FTLD-TDP
      type IV and Braak stage five Parkinson's disease (PD). A VCP R191Q
      mutation was found. Pennsylvania family: 11 subjects developed IBMPFD.
      Parkinsonism was noted in two mutation carriers, whilst another subject
      presented with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). A novel VCP T262A
      mutation was found. Indiana family: three subjects developed IBMPFD. FTD
      was diagnosed in two individuals and suspected in the third one who also
      displayed muscle weakness. A VCP R159C mutation was found. CONCLUSIONS: We
      identified three families with IBMPFD associated with VCP mutations.
      Clinical and pathological PD was documented for the first time in members
      of two families. A novel T262A mutation was found. One individual had PPA:
      an uncommon presentation of IBMPFD.

    title: Genetic susceptibility for alzheimer disease neuritic plaque pathology

    abstract: >-
      Importance  While numerous genetic susceptibility loci have been
      identified for clinical Alzheimer disease (AD), it is important to
      establish whether these variants are risk factors for the underlying
      disease pathology, including neuritic plaques.Objectives  To investigate
      whether AD susceptibility loci from genome-wide association studies affect
      neuritic plaque pathology and to additionally identify novel risk loci for
      this trait.Design, Setting, and Participants  Candidate analysis of
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genome-wide association study in a
      joint clinicopathologic cohort, including 725 deceased subjects from the
      Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (2
      prospective, community-based studies), followed by targeted validation in
      an independent neuroimaging cohort, including 114 subjects from multiple
      clinical and research centers.Main Outcomes and Measures  A quantitative
      measure of neuritic plaque pathologic burden, based on assessments of
      silver-stained tissue averaged from multiple brain regions. Validation
      based on β-amyloid load by immunocytochemistry, and replication with
      fibrillar β-amyloid positron emission tomographic imaging with Pittsburgh
      Compound B or florbetapir.Results  Besides the previously reported APOE
      and CR1 loci, we found that the ABCA7 (rs3764650; P = .02) and CD2AP
      (rs9349407; P = .03) AD susceptibility loci are associated with neuritic
      plaque burden. In addition, among the top results of our genome-wide
      association study, we discovered a novel variant near the amyloid
      precursor protein gene (APP, rs2829887) that is associated with neuritic
      plaques (P = 3.3 × 10−6). This polymorphism was associated with postmortem
      β-amyloid load as well as fibrillar β-amyloid in 2 independent cohorts of
      adults with normal cognition.Conclusions and Relevance  These findings
      enhance understanding of AD risk factors by relating validated
      susceptibility alleles to increased neuritic plaque pathology and
      implicate common genetic variation at the APP locus in the earliest,
      presymptomatic stages of AD.

      The Genetics Core of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      (ADNI), formally established in 2009, aims to provide resources and
      facilitate research related to genetic predictors of multidimensional
      Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related phenotypes. Here, we provide a systematic
      review of genetic studies published between 2009 and 2012 where either
      ADNI APOE genotype or genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were used.
      We review and synthesize ADNI genetic associations with disease status or
      quantitative disease endophenotypes including structural and functional
      neuroimaging, fluid biomarker assays, and cognitive performance.We also
      discuss the diverse analytical strategies used in these studies, including
      univariate and multivariate analysis, meta-analysis, pathway analysis, and
      interaction and network analysis. Finally, we perform pathway and network
      enrichment analyses of these ADNI genetic associations to highlight key
      mechanisms that may drive disease onset and trajectory. Major ADNI
      findings included all the top 10 AD genes and several of these (e.g.,
      APOE, BIN1, CLU, CR1, and PICALM) were corroborated by ADNI imaging, fluid
      and cognitive phenotypes. ADNI imaging genetics studies discovered novel
      findings (e.g., FRMD6) that were later replicated on different data sets.
      Several other genes (e.g., APOC1, FTO, GRIN2B, MAGI2, and TOMM40) were
      associated with multiple ADNI phenotypes, warranting further investigation
      on other data sets. The broad availability and wide scope of ADNI genetic
      and phenotypic data has advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of
      AD and has nominated novel targets for future studies employing
      next-generation sequencing and convergent multi-omics approaches, and for
      clinical drug and biomarker development.

      Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex disorder influenced by environmental
      and genetic factors. Recent work has identified 11 AD markers in 10 loci.
      We used Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis to analyze &#62;2 million SNPs
      for 10,922 individuals from the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium to
      assess the phenotypic variance explained first by known late-onset AD
      loci, and then by all SNPs in the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium
      dataset. In all, 33% of total phenotypic variance is explained by all
      common SNPs. APOE alone explained 6% and other known markers 2%, meaning
      more than 25% of phenotypic variance remains unexplained by known markers,
      but is tagged by common SNPs included on genotyping arrays or imputed with
      HapMap genotypes. Novel AD markers that explain large amounts of
      phenotypic variance are likely to be rare and unidentifiable using
      genome-wide association studies. Based on our findings and the current
      direction of human genetics research, we suggest specific study designs
      for future studies to identify the remaining heritability of Alzheimer’s
      disease.

      Mitochondrial Haplotypes Associated with Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s

    abstract: >-
      &#60;p&#62;Various studies have suggested that the mitochondrial genome
      plays a role in late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, although results are
      mixed. We used an endophenotype-based approach to further characterize
      mitochondrial genetic variation and its relationship to risk markers for
      Alzheimer’s disease. We analyzed longitudinal data from non-demented, mild
      cognitive impairment, and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease participants in
      the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with genetic, brain
      imaging, and behavioral data. We assessed the relationship of structural
      MRI and cognitive biomarkers with mitochondrial genome variation using
      TreeScanning, a haplotype-based approach that concentrates statistical
      power by analyzing evolutionarily meaningful groups (or clades) of
      haplotypes together for association with a phenotype. Four clades were
      associated with three different endophenotypes: whole brain volume,
      percent change in temporal pole thickness, and left hippocampal atrophy
      over two years. This is the first study of its kind to identify
      mitochondrial variation associated with brain imaging endophenotypes of
      Alzheimer’s disease. Our results provide additional evidence that the
      mitochondrial genome plays a role in risk for Alzheimer’s
      disease.&#60;/p&#62;

      Variants in the ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter (ABCA7), Apolipoprotein E
      [epsilon]4,and the Risk of Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease in African

    journal: JAMA

      Importance: Genetic variants associated with susceptibility to late-onset
      Alzheimer disease are known for individuals of European ancestry, but
      whether the same or different variants account for the genetic risk of
      Alzheimer disease in African American individuals is unknown.
      Identification of disease-associated variants helps identify targets for
      genetic testing, prevention, and treatment., Objective: To identify
      genetic loci associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease in African
      Americans., Design, Setting, and Participants: The Alzheimer Disease
      Genetics Consortium (ADGC) assembled multiple data sets representing a
      total of 5896 African Americans (1968 case participants, 3928 control
      participants) 60 years or older that were collected between 1989 and 2011
      at multiple sites. The association of Alzheimer disease with genotyped and
      imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed in
      case-control and in family-based data sets. Results from individual data
      sets were combined to perform an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis,
      first with genome-wide analyses and subsequently with gene-based tests for
      previously reported loci., Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of
      Alzheimer disease according to standardized criteria., Results:
      Genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE
      genotype, population stratification) was observed for a SNP in ABCA7
      (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06 controls; odds
      ratio [OR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.47-2.12]; P = 2.2 x 10-9), which is in linkage
      disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with Alzheimer disease in
      Europeans (0.8&#60;D'&#60;0.9). The effect size for the SNP in ABCA7 was
      comparable with that of the APOE [epsilon]4-determining SNP rs429358
      (allele = C; frequency, 0.30 cases and 0.18 controls; OR, 2.31 [95% CI,
      2.19-2.42]; P = 5.5 x 10-47). Several loci previously associated with
      Alzheimer disease but not reaching significance in genome-wide analyses
      were replicated in gene-based analyses accounting for linkage
      disequilibrium between markers and correcting for number of tests
      performed per gene (CR1, BIN1, EPHA1, CD33; 0.0005&#60;empirical P &#60;
      .001)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-analysis of data from
      African American participants, Alzheimer disease was significantly
      associated with variants in ABCA7 and with other genes that have been
      associated with Alzheimer disease in individuals of European ancestry.

      Independent and epistatic effects of variants in VPS10-d receptors on
      Alzheimer disease risk and processing of the amyloid precursor protein
      (APP)
    journal: Transl Psychiatry Psychiatry
    volume: 3

    abstract: >-
      Genetic variants in the sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) and the
      sortilin-related vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) domain-containing
      receptor 1 (SORCS1) are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), declining cognitive function and altered amyloid precursor
      protein (APP) processing. We explored whether other members of the (VPS10)
      domain-containing receptor protein family (the sortilin-related VPS10
      domain-containing receptors 2 and 3 (SORCS2 and SORCS3) and sortilin
      (SORT1)) would have similar effects either independently or together. We
      conducted the analyses in a large Caucasian case control data set
      (n=11,840 cases, 10,931 controls) to determine the associations between
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all the five homologous genes
      and AD risk. Evidence for interactions between SNPs in the five VPS10
      domain receptor family genes was determined in epistatic statistical
      models. We also compared expression levels of SORCS2, SORCS3 and SORT1 in
      AD and control brains using microarray gene expression analyses and
      assessed the effects of these genes on -secretase processing of APP.
      Several SNPs in SORL1, SORCS1, SORCS2 and SORCS3 were associated with AD.
      In addition, four specific linkage disequilibrium blocks in SORCS1, SORCS2
      and SORCS3 showed additive epistatic effects on the risk of AD
      (P&#60;=0.0006). SORCS3, but not SORCS2 or SORT1, showed reduced
      expression in AD compared with control brains, but knockdown of all the
      three genes using short hairpin RNAs in HEK293 cells caused a significant
      threefold increase in APP processing (from P&#60;0.001 to P&#60;0.05).
      These findings indicate that in addition to SORL1 and SORCS1, variants in
      other members of the VPS10 domain receptor family (that is, SORCS1,
      SORCS2, SORCS3) are associated with AD risk and alter APP processing. More
      importantly, the results indicate that variants within these genes have
      epistatic effects on AD risk.

      Increased in Vivo Amyloid-β42 Production, Exchange, and Loss in Presenilin
      Mutation Carriers
    journal: Science Translational Medicine
    volume: 5
    issue: 189
    pages: 189ra77
    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is hypothesized to be caused by an overproduction
      or reduced clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Autosomal dominant AD
      (ADAD) caused by mutations in the presenilin (PSEN) gene have been
      postulated to result from increased production of Aβ42 compared to Aβ40 in
      the central nervous system (CNS). This has been demonstrated in rodent
      models of ADAD but not in human mutation carriers. We used compartmental
      modeling of stable isotope labeling kinetic (SILK) studies in human
      carriers of PSEN mutations and related noncarriers to evaluate the
      pathophysiological effects of PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations on the production
      and turnover of Aβ isoforms. We compared these findings by mutation status
      and amount of fibrillar amyloid deposition as measured by positron
      emission tomography (PET) using the amyloid tracer Pittsburgh compound B
      (PIB). CNS Aβ42 to Aβ40 production rates were 24% higher in mutation
      carriers compared to noncarriers, and this was independent of fibrillar
      amyloid deposits quantified by PET PIB imaging. The fractional turnover
      rate of soluble Aβ42 relative to Aβ40 was 65% faster in mutation carriers
      and correlated with amyloid deposition, consistent with increased
      deposition of Aβ42 into plaques, leading to reduced recovery of Aβ42 in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Reversible exchange of Aβ42 peptides with
      preexisting unlabeled peptide was observed in the presence of plaques.
      These findings support the hypothesis that Aβ42 is overproduced in the CNS
      of humans with PSEN mutations that cause AD, and demonstrate that soluble
      Aβ42 turnover and exchange processes are altered in the presence of
      amyloid plaques, causing a reduction in Aβ42 concentrations in the CSF.

      Identification of functional variants from whole-exome sequencing,

    abstract: >-
      The image illustrates the schematic view for discovery of functional
      variants from whole-exome sequencing. We report on a novel strategy
      combining whole-exome sequencing and neuroimaging genetics to identify
      functional variants associated with the rate of hippocampal volume loss in
      mild cognitive impairment. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on a
      modest sample using an extreme trait design by selecting individuals at
      the extremes of the distribution of 2-year longitudinal change in
      hippocampal volume. To further investigate and extend the exome findings
      in a larger sample, we conducted quantitative trait analysis, including
      whole-brain search, combined with genotype imputation. Finally,
      meta-analysis was performed to validate the exome findings across five
      independent cross-sectional cohorts. Combining next-generation sequencing
      and quantitative imaging phenotypes holds promise for the discovery of
      variants involved in neurodegeneration and other brain disorders. For more
      information on this topic, please refer to the article by Nho et al. on
      pages 781–787.

      Whole-exome sequencing and imaging genetics identify functional variants
      for rate of change in hippocampal volume in mild cognitive impairment
    journal: Mol Psychiatry
    volume: 18
    issue: 7
    pages: 781-787
    abstract: >-
      Whole-exome sequencing of individuals with mild cognitive impairment,
      combined with genotype imputation, was used to identify coding variants
      other than the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele associated with rate of
      hippocampal volume loss using an extreme trait design. Matched unrelated
      APOE ε3 homozygous male Caucasian participants from the Alzheimer’s
      Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were selected at the extremes of
      the 2-year longitudinal change distribution of hippocampal volume (eight
      subjects with rapid rates of atrophy and eight with slow/stable rates of
      atrophy). We identified 57 non-synonymous single nucleotide variants
      (SNVs) which were found exclusively in at least 4 of 8 subjects in the
      rapid atrophy group, but not in any of the 8 subjects in the slow atrophy
      group. Among these SNVs, the variants that accounted for the greatest
      group difference and were predicted in silico as ‘probably damaging’
      missense variants were rs9610775 (CARD10) and rs1136410 (PARP1). To
      further investigate and extend the exome findings in a larger sample, we
      conducted quantitative trait analysis including whole-brain search in the
      remaining ADNI APOE ε3/ε3 group (N=315). Genetic variation within PARP1
      and CARD10 was associated with rate of hippocampal neurodegeneration in
      APOE ε3/ε3. Meta-analysis across five independent cross sectional cohorts
      indicated that rs1136410 is also significantly associated with hippocampal
      volume in APOE ε3/ε3 individuals (N=923). Larger sequencing studies and
      longitudinal follow-up are needed for confirmation. The combination of
      next-generation sequencing and quantitative imaging phenotypes holds
      significant promise for discovery of variants involved in
      neurodegeneration.

      &#60;p&#62;To discover susceptibility genes of late-onset Alzheimer’s
      disease (LOAD), we conducted a 3-stage genome-wide association study
      (GWAS) using three populations: Japanese from the Japanese Genetic
      Consortium for Alzheimer Disease (JGSCAD), Koreans, and Caucasians from
      the Alzheimer Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC). In Stage 1, we evaluated
      data for 5,877,918 genotyped and imputed SNPs in Japanese cases
      (n = 1,008) and controls (n = 1,016). Genome-wide significance was
      observed with 12 SNPs in the &#60;italic&#62;APOE&#60;/italic&#62; region.
      Seven SNPs from other distinct regions with p-values
      &lt;2×10&#60;sup&#62;−5&#60;/sup&#62; were genotyped in a second Japanese
      sample (885 cases, 985 controls), and evidence of association was
      confirmed for one &#60;italic&#62;SORL1&#60;/italic&#62; SNP (rs3781834,
      P = 7.33×10&#60;sup&#62;−7&#60;/sup&#62; in the combined sample).
      Subsequent analysis combining results for several SORL1 SNPs in the
      Japanese, Korean (339 cases, 1,129 controls) and Caucasians (11,840 AD
      cases, 10,931 controls) revealed genome wide significance with rs11218343
      (P = 1.77×10&#60;sup&#62;−9&#60;/sup&#62;) and rs3781834
      (P = 1.04×10&#60;sup&#62;−8&#60;/sup&#62;). SNPs in previously established
      AD loci in Caucasians showed strong evidence of association in Japanese
      including rs3851179 near &#60;italic&#62;PICALM&#60;/italic&#62;
      (P = 1.71×10&#60;sup&#62;−5&#60;/sup&#62;) and rs744373 near
      &#60;italic&#62;BIN1&#60;/italic&#62;
      (P = 1.39×10&#60;sup&#62;−4&#60;/sup&#62;). The associated allele for each
      of these SNPs was the same as in Caucasians. These data demonstrate for
      the first time genome-wide significance of LOAD with
      &#60;italic&#62;SORL1&#60;/italic&#62; and confirm the role of other known
      loci for LOAD in Japanese. Our study highlights the importance of
      examining associations in multiple ethnic populations.&#60;/p&#62;

      Genetic interactions associated with 12-month atrophy in hippocampus and
      entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging

    abstract: >-
      Missing heritability in late onset Alzheimer disease can be attributed, at
      least in part, to heterogeneity in disease status and to the lack of
      statistical analyses exploring genetic interactions. In the current study,
      we use quantitative intermediate phenotypes derived from magnetic
      resonance imaging data available from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative, and we test for association with gene-gene interactions within
      biological pathways. Regional brain volumes from the hippocampus (HIP) and
      entorhinal cortex (EC) were estimated from baseline and 12-month magnetic
      resonance imaging scans. Approximately 560,000 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) were available genome-wide. We tested all pairwise
      SNP-SNP interactions (approximately 151 million) within 212 Kyoto
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways for association with 12-month
      regional atrophy rates using linear regression, with sex, APOE ε4 carrier
      status, age, education, and clinical status as covariates. A total of 109
      SNP-SNP interactions were associated with right HIP atrophy, and 125 were
      associated with right EC atrophy. Enrichment analysis indicated
      significant SNP-SNP interactions were overrepresented in the calcium
      signaling and axon guidance pathways for both HIP and EC atrophy and in
      the ErbB signaling pathway for HIP atrophy.

      Effects of baseline CSF alpha-synuclein on regional brain atrophy rates in
      healthy elders, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
    journal: PLoS One
    volume: 8
    issue: 12
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alpha-synuclein is reduced in
      synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies, and some studies
      have found increased CSF alpha-synuclein in Alzheimer's disease (AD). No
      study has explored effects of CSF alpha-synuclein on brain atrophy. Here
      we tested if baseline CSF alpha-synuclein affects brain atrophy rates and
      if these effects vary across brain regions, and across the cognitive
      spectrum from healthy elders (NL), to patients with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS: Baseline CSF alpha-synuclein
      measurements and longitudinal structural brain magnetic resonance imaging
      was performed in 74 NL, 118 MCI patients and 55 AD patients. Effects of
      baseline CSF alpha-synuclein on regional atrophy rates were tested in 1)
      four pre-hoc defined regions possibly associated with Lewy body and/or AD
      pathology (amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, brainstem), and 2) all
      available regions of interest. Differences across diagnoses were tested by
      assessing the interaction of CSF alpha-synuclein and diagnosis (testing NL
      versus MCI, and NL versus AD). RESULTS: The effects of CSF alpha-synuclein
      on longitudinal atrophy rates were not significant after correction for
      multiple comparisons. There were tendencies for effects in AD in caudate
      (higher atrophy rates in subjects with higher CSF alpha-synuclein,
      P=0.046) and brainstem (higher atrophy rates in subjects with lower CSF
      alpha-synuclein, P=0.063). CSF alpha-synuclein had significantly different
      effects on atrophy rates in NL and AD in brainstem (P=0.037) and caudate
      (P=0.006). DISCUSSION: With the possible exception of caudate and
      brainstem, the overall weak effects of CSF alpha-synuclein on atrophy
      rates in NL, MCI and AD argues against CSF alpha-synuclein as a biomarker
      related to longitudinal brain atrophy in these diagnostic groups. Any
      effects of CSF alpha-synuclein may be attenuated by possible simultaneous
      occurrence of AD-related neuronal injury and concomitant Lewy body
      pathology, which may elevate and reduce CSF alpha-synuclein levels,
      respectively.

    abstract: >-
      Eleven susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) were
      identified by previous studies; however, a large portion of the genetic
      risk for this disease remains unexplained. We conducted a large, two-stage
      meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of
      European ancestry. In stage 1 1, we used genotyped and imputed data
      (7,055,881 1 SNPs) to perform meta-analysis on 4 previously published GWAS
      data sets consisting of 1 17,008 Alzheimer’s disease cases and 37,154
      controls. In stage 2, 11 11 11,632 SNPs were genotyped and tested for
      association in an independent set of 8,572 Alzheimer’s disease cases and
      11 11 11,312 controls.

      Repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene contribute to Alzheimer's disease in
      Caucasians
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 34
    issue: 5
    pages: 1519.e5-1519.e12
    abstract: >-
      Recently, a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene has been
      identified to account for a significant portion of Caucasian families
      affected by frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS). Given the clinical overlap of FTD with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), we hypothesized that C9ORF72 expansions might contribute to
      AD. In Caucasians, we found C9ORF72 expansions in the pathogenic range of
      FTD/ALS (&#62;30 repeats) at a proportion of 0.76% in AD cases versus 0 in
      control subjects (p = 3.3E-03; 1182 cases, 1039 controls). In contrast, no
      large expansions were detected in individuals of African American
      ethnicity (291 cases, 620 controls). However, in the range of normal
      variation of C9ORF72 expansions (0–23 repeat copies), we detected
      significant differences in distribution and mean repeat counts between
      Caucasians and African Americans. Clinical and pathological re-evaluation
      of identified C9ORF72 expansion carriers revealed 9 clinical and/or
      autopsy confirmed AD and 2 FTD final diagnoses. Thus, our results support
      the notion that large C9ORF72 expansions lead to a phenotypic spectrum of
      neurodegenerative disease including AD.

      Multilocus genetic profiling to empower drug trials and predict brain
      atrophy
    journal: "NeuroImage: Clinical"

    pages: 827-835
    abstract: >-
      Designers of clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) are actively considering structural and
      functional neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid and genetic biomarkers to
      reduce the sample sizes needed to detect therapeutic effects. Genetic
      pre-selection, however, has been limited to Apolipoprotein E (ApoE).
      Recently discovered polymorphisms in the CLU, CR1 and PICALM genes are
      also moderate risk factors for AD; each affects lifetime AD risk by ~
      10–20%. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pre-selecting subjects based
      on these variants along with ApoE genotype would further boost clinical
      trial power, relative to considering ApoE alone, using an MRI-derived
      2-year atrophy rate as our outcome measure. We ranked subjects from the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) based on their
      cumulative risk from these four genes. We obtained sample size estimates
      in cohorts enriched in subjects with greater aggregate genetic risk.
      Enriching for additional genetic biomarkers reduced the required sample
      sizes by up to 50%, for MCI trials. Thus, AD drug trial enrichment with
      multiple genotypes may have potential implications for the timeliness,
      cost, and power of trials.

      Influence of Genetic Variation on Plasma Protein Levels in Older Adults
      Using a Multi-Analyte Panel
    journal: PLoS One
    volume: 8
    issue: 7
    pages: e70269
    abstract: >-
      &#60;p&#62;Proteins, widely studied as potential biomarkers, play
      important roles in numerous physiological functions and diseases. Genetic
      variation may modulate corresponding protein levels and point to the role
      of these variants in disease pathophysiology. Effects of individual single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a gene were analyzed for
      corresponding plasma protein levels using genome-wide association study
      (GWAS) genotype data and proteomic panel data with 132 quality-controlled
      analytes from 521 Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer’s Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Linear regression analysis detected
      112 significant (Bonferroni threshold
      &#60;italic&#62;p&#60;/italic&#62; = 2.44×10&#60;sup&#62;−5&#60;/sup&#62;)
      associations between 27 analytes and 112 SNPs. 107 out of these 112
      associations were tested in the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS)
      cohort for replication and 50 associations were replicated at uncorrected
      &#60;italic&#62;p&#60;/italic&#62;&lt;0.05 in the same direction of effect
      as those in the ADNI. We identified multiple novel associations including
      the association of rs7517126 with plasma complement factor H-related
      protein 1 (CFHR1) level at
      &#60;italic&#62;p&#60;/italic&#62;&lt;1.46×10&#60;sup&#62;−60&#60;/sup&#62;,
      accounting for 40 percent of total variation of the protein level. We
      serendipitously found the association of rs6677604 with the same protein
      at
      &#60;italic&#62;p&#60;/italic&#62;&lt;9.29×10&#60;sup&#62;−112&#60;/sup&#62;.
      Although these two SNPs were not in the strong linkage disequilibrium, 61
      percent of total variation of CFHR1 was accounted for by rs6677604 without
      additional variation by rs7517126 when both SNPs were tested together. 78
      other SNP-protein associations in the ADNI sample exceeded genome-wide
      significance (5×10&#60;sup&#62;−8&#60;/sup&#62;). Our results confirmed
      previously identified gene-protein associations for interleukin-6
      receptor, chemokine CC-4, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and
      angiotensinogen, although the direction of effect was reversed in some
      cases. This study is among the first analyses of gene-protein product
      relationships integrating multiplex-panel proteomics and targeted genes
      extracted from a GWAS array. With intensive searches taking place for
      proteomic biomarkers for many diseases, the role of genetic variation
      takes on new importance and should be considered in interpretation of
      proteomic results.&#60;/p&#62;

      Novel progranulin variants do not disrupt progranulin secretion and
      cleavage
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 34
    issue: 11
    pages: 2538-2540
    abstract: >-
      A subset of frontotemporal dementia cases are neuropathologically defined
      by tau-negative, TAR DNA-binding protein-43, and ubiquitin-positive
      inclusions in the brain and are associated with mutations in the
      progranulin gene (GRN). Deep sequencing of families exhibiting late-onset
      dementia revealed several novel variants in GRN. Because of the small size
      of these families and limited availability of samples, it was not possible
      to determine whether the variants segregated with the disease.
      Furthermore, none of these families had autopsy confirmation of diagnosis.
      We sought to determine if these novel GRN variants alter progranulin
      (PGRN) protein stability, PGRN secretion, and PGRN cleavage in cultured
      cells. All the novel GRN variants behave like PGRN wild-type protein,
      suggesting that these variants represent rare polymorphisms. However, it
      remains possible that these variants affect other aspects of PGRN function
      or represent risk factors for dementia when combined with other modifying
      genes.

    title: Variant of TREM2 associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease
    journal: N Engl J Med
    volume: 368
    issue: 2
    pages: 107-16
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Sequence variants, including the epsilon4 allele of
      apolipoprotein E, have been associated with the risk of the common
      late-onset form of Alzheimer's disease. Few rare variants affecting the
      risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have been found. METHODS: We
      obtained the genome sequences of 2261 Icelanders and identified sequence
      variants that were likely to affect protein function. We imputed these
      variants into the genomes of patients with Alzheimer's disease and control
      participants and then tested for an association with Alzheimer's disease.
      We performed replication tests using case-control series from the United
      States, Norway, The Netherlands, and Germany. We also tested for a genetic
      association with cognitive function in a population of unaffected elderly
      persons. RESULTS: A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene
      encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2),
      which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer
      a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland (odds ratio, 2.92;
      95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09 to 4.09; P=3.42x10(-10)). The mutation
      had a frequency of 0.46% in controls 85 years of age or older. We observed
      the association in additional sample sets (odds ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 2.16
      to 3.91; P=2.1x10(-12) in combined discovery and replication samples). We
      also found that carriers of rs75932628-T between the ages of 80 and 100
      years without Alzheimer's disease had poorer cognitive function than
      noncarriers (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings strongly implicate
      variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Given the
      reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H
      substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's
      disease through impaired containment of inflammatory processes. (Funded by
      the National Institute on Aging and others.).

      BACKGROUND/AIMS: Few studies of gene variants that affect estrogen
      activity investigate their association with risk for AD in women of
      different ethnicities. We investigated the influence of CYP19
      polymorphisms on risk for AD in a multiethnic cohort of women, with
      individual ethnicity assessed by genetic population ancestry markers
      (AIMs) as well as by self -identified ethnicity. METHODS: Among 1686 women
      participating in the Washington Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project
      (WHICAP), association with risk for AD was assessed for 41
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the CYP19 gene using
      multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, presence of an APOE
      ε4 allele, years of education, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Risk
      for AD was associated with six SNPs in women of predominantly Caucasian
      AIMs-defined ancestry. Of these, two were also associated with decreased
      risk of AD in women of admixed/ Hispanic AIMs ancestry. Two separate SNPs
      were found to be protective in women of predominantly African AIMs-based
      ancestry. CONCLUSIONS: CYP19 polymorphisms affect risk for AD in women,
      and risk alleles vary by AIMs-defined ancestry. These effects are possibly
      due to linkage disequilibrium patterns or differences in the prevalence of
      comorbid risk factors mediating SNP effect on risk for AD by group.

      Genome-wide scan of healthy human connectome discovers SPON1 gene variant
      influencing dementia severity

    abstract: >-
      Aberrant connectivity is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric
      disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. However, other
      than a few disease-associated candidate genes, we know little about the
      degree to which genetics play a role in the brain networks; we know even
      less about specific genes that influence brain connections. Twin and
      family-based studies can generate estimates of overall genetic influences
      on a trait, but genome-wide association scans (GWASs) can screen the
      genome for specific variants influencing the brain or risk for disease. To
      identify the heritability of various brain connections, we scanned healthy
      young adult twins with high-field, high-angular resolution diffusion MRI.
      We adapted GWASs to screen the brain’s connectivity pattern, allowing us
      to discover genetic variants that affect the human brain’s wiring. The
      association of connectivity with the SPON1 variant at rs2618516 on
      chromosome 11 (11p15.2) reached connectome-wide, genome-wide significance
      after stringent statistical corrections were enforced, and it was
      replicated in an independent subsample. rs2618516 was shown to affect
      brain structure in an elderly population with varying degrees of dementia.
      Older people who carried the connectivity variant had significantly milder
      clinical dementia scores and lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. As a
      posthoc analysis, we conducted GWASs on several organizational and
      topological network measures derived from the matrices to discover
      variants in and around genes associated with autism (MACROD2), development
      (NEDD4), and mental retardation (UBE2A) significantly associated with
      connectivity. Connectome-wide, genome-wide screening offers substantial
      promise to discover genes affecting brain connectivity and risk for brain
      diseases.

      is a biological process strongly determined by genetics. However, only a
      few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported to be
      consistently associated with aging. While investigating whether copy
      number variations (CNVs) could fill this gap, we focused on CNVs that have
      not been studied in previous SNP-based searches

      qPCR assays were developed to quantify 20 common CNVs in 222 senior
      American Caucasians in order to reveal possible association with
      longevity. The replication study was comprised of 1283 community-dwelling
      senior European Caucasians. Replicated CNVs were further investigated for
      association with healthy aging and aging-related diseases, while
      association with longevity was additionally tested in

      with survival to the age of 80 (OR=0.51, 95%CI 0.29-0.87, p=0.015 before

      remained significant in females (OR=0.41, 95%CI 0.21-0.77, p=0.007), but
      not in males (OR=0.97, 95%CI 0.33-2.79, p=1). The finding was validated in
      a replication study (OR=0.66, 95%CI 0.48-0.90, p=0.011 for females).

      Rare autosomal copy number variations in early-onset familial Alzheimer/'s

    abstract: >-
      Over 200 rare and fully penetrant pathogenic mutations in amyloid
      precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2) cause a
      subset of early-onset familial Alzheimer’s disease (EO-FAD). Of these, 21
      cases of EO-FAD families carrying unique APP locus duplications remain the
      only pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs) identified to date in
      Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using high-density DNA microarrays, we performed
      a comprehensive genome-wide analysis for the presence of rare CNVs in 261
      EO-FAD and early/mixed-onset pedigrees. Our analysis revealed 10 novel
      private CNVs in 10 EO-FAD families overlapping a set of genes that
      includes: A2BP1, ABAT, CDH2, CRMP1, DMRT1, EPHA5, EPHA6, ERMP1, EVC, EVC2,
      FLJ35024 and VLDLR. In addition, CNVs encompassing two known
      frontotemporal dementia genes, CHMP2B and MAPT were found. To our
      knowledge, this is the first study reporting rare gene-rich CNVs in EO-FAD
      and early/mixed-onset AD that are likely to underlie pathogenicity in
      familial AD and perhaps related dementias.

      Characterizing the Role of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Genetic
      Variation in Alzheimer’s Disease Neurodegeneration
    journal: PLoS One

    abstract: >-
      &#60;p&#62;There is accumulating evidence that neurotrophins, like
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&#60;italic&#62;BDNF&#60;/italic&#62;),
      may impact aging and Alzheimer’s Disease. However, traditional genetic
      association studies have not found a clear relationship between
      &#60;italic&#62;BDNF&#60;/italic&#62; and AD. Our goal was to test whether
      &#60;italic&#62;BDNF&#60;/italic&#62; single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) impact Alzheimer’s Disease-related brain imaging and cognitive
      markers of disease. We completed an imaging genetics study on 645
      Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (ND=175, MCI=316,
      AD=154) who had cognitive, brain imaging, and genetics data at baseline
      and a subset of those with brain imaging data at two years. Samples were
      genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. 13 SNPs in BDNF were
      identified in the dataset following quality control measures
      (rs6265(Val66Met), rs12273363, rs11030094, rs925946, rs1050187, rs2203877,
      rs11030104, rs11030108, rs10835211, rs7934165, rs908867, rs1491850,
      rs1157459). We analyzed a subgroup of 8 SNPs that were in low linkage
      disequilibrium with each other. Automated brain morphometric measures were
      available through ADNI investigators, and we analyzed baseline cognitive
      scores, hippocampal and whole brain volumes, and rates of hippocampal and
      whole brain atrophy and rates of change in the ADAS-Cog over one and two
      years. Three out of eight &#60;italic&#62;BDNF&#60;/italic&#62; SNPs
      analyzed were significantly associated with measures of cognitive decline
      (rs1157659, rs11030094, rs11030108). No SNPs were significantly associated
      with baseline brain volume measures, however six SNPs were significantly
      associated with hippocampal and/or whole brain atrophy over two years
      (rs908867, rs11030094, rs6265, rs10501087, rs1157659, rs1491850). We also
      found an interaction between the &#60;italic&#62;BDNF&#60;/italic&#62;
      Val66Met SNP and age with whole brain volume. Our imaging-genetics
      analysis in a large dataset suggests that while BDNF genetic variation is
      not specifically associated with a diagnosis of AD, it appears to play a
      role in AD-related brain neurodegeneration.&#60;/p&#62;

    abstract: >-
      Recent genome wide association studies have identified CLU, CR1, ABCA7
      BIN1, PICALM and MS4A6A/MS4A6E in addition to the long established APOE,
      as loci for Alzheimer’s disease. We have systematically examined each of
      these loci to assess whether common coding variability contributes to the
      risk of disease. We have also assessed the regional expression of all the
      genes in the brain and whether there is evidence of an eQTL explaining the
      risk. In agreement with other studies we find that coding variability may
      explain the ABCA7 association, but common coding variability does not
      explain any of the other loci. We were not able to show that any of the
      loci had eQTLs within the power of this study. Furthermore the regional
      expression of each of the loci did not match the pattern of brain regional
      distribution in Alzheimer pathology. Although these results are mainly
      negative, they allow us to start defining more realistic alternative
      approaches to determine the role of all the genetic loci involved in
      Alzheimer’s disease.

      Genome-wide association identifies genetic variants associated with

    abstract: >-
      Deficits in lentiform nucleus volume and morphometry are implicated in a
      number of genetically influenced disorders, including Parkinson’s disease,
      schizophrenia, and ADHD. Here we performed genome-wide searches to
      discover common genetic variants associated with differences in lentiform
      nucleus volume in human populations. We assessed structural MRI scans of
      the brain in two large genotyped samples: the Alzheimer’s Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; N = 706) and the Queensland Twin Imaging
      Study (QTIM; N = 639). Statistics of association from each cohort were
      combined meta-analytically using a fixed-effects model to boost power and
      to reduce the prevalence of false positive findings. We identified a
      number of associations in and around the flavin-containing monooxygenase
      (FMO) gene cluster. The most highly associated SNP, rs1795240, was located
      in the FMO3 gene; after meta-analysis, it showed genome-wide significant
      evidence of association with lentiform nucleus volume (P MA
       = 4.79 × 10−8). This commonly-carried genetic variant accounted for 2.68
      % and 0.84 % of the trait variability in the ADNI and QTIM samples,
      respectively, even though the QTIM sample was on average 50 years younger.
      Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant contributions of this
      gene to the cytochrome P450 pathway, which is involved in metabolizing
      numerous therapeutic drugs for pain, seizures, mania, depression, anxiety,
      and psychosis. The genetic variants we identified provide replicated,
      genome-wide significant evidence for the FMO gene cluster’s involvement in
      lentiform nucleus volume differences in human populations.

    abstract: >-
      Importance: Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open
      reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene underlie a significant fraction of
      frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis., Objective: To
      investigate the frequency of C9orf72 repeat expansions in clinically
      diagnosed late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD)., Design, Setting, and
      Patients: This case-control study genotyped the C9orf72 repeat expansion
      in 872 unrelated familial AD cases and 888 control subjects recruited as
      part of the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease
      Family Study cohort, a multisite collaboration studying 1000 families with
      2 or more individuals clinically diagnosed as having late-onset AD., Main
      Outcomes and Measures: We determined the presence or absence of the
      C9orf72 repeat expansion by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, the
      length of the longest nonexpanded allele, segregation of the genotype with
      disease, and clinical features of repeat expansion carriers., Results:
      Three families showed large C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions. Two
      additional families carried more than 30 repeats. Segregation with disease
      could be demonstrated in 3 families. One affected expansion carrier had

      Increased CNV-Region deletions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects in the ADNI sample
    journal: Genomics

    abstract: >-
      We investigated the genome-wide distribution of CNVs in the Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) sample (146 with AD, 313 with
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and 181 controls).  Comparison of single
      CNVs between cases (MCI and AD) and controls shows overrepresentation of
      large heterozygous deletions in cases (p-value &#60; 0.0001). The analysis
      of CNV-Regions identifies 44 copy number variable loci of heterozygous
      deletions, with more CNV-Regions among affected than controls (p = 0.005).
      Seven of the 44 CNV-Regions are nominally significant for association with
      cognitive impairment. We validated and confirmed our main findings with
      genome re-sequencing of selected patients and controls. The functional
      pathway analysis of the genes putatively affected by deletions of
      CNV-Regions reveals enrichment of genes implicated in axonal guidance,
      cell–cell adhesion, neuronal morphogenesis and differentiation. Our
      findings support the role of CNVs in AD, and suggest an association
      between large deletions and the development of cognitive impairment

      Variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 are

    volume: 34

    abstract: >-
      Recent evidence suggests that rare genetic variants within the TREM2 gene
      are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. TREM2 mutations
      are the genetic basis for a condition characterized by polycystic
      lipomembranous osteodysplasia with sclerosing leukoencephalopathy (PLOSL)
      and an early-onset dementia syndrome. TREM2 is important in the
      phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal cells by microglia in the brain. Loss
      of function might lead to an impaired clearance and to accumulation of
      necrotic debris and subsequent neurodegeneration. In this study, we
      investigated a consanguineous family segregating autosomal recessive
      behavioral variant FTLD from Antioquia, Colombia. Exome sequencing
      identified a nonsense mutation in TREM2 (p.Trp198X) segregating with
      disease. Next, using a cohort of clinically characterized and
      neuropathologically verified sporadic AD cases and controls, we report
      replication of the AD risk association at rs75932628 within TREM2 and
      demonstrate that TREM2 is significantly overexpressed in the brain tissue
      from AD cases. These data suggest that a mutational burden in TREM2 may
      serve as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease in general, and that
      potentially this class of TREM2 variant carriers with dementia should be
      considered as having a molecularly distinct form of neurodegenerative
      disease.

    title: Brain changes in older adults at very low risk for Alzheimer's disease
    journal: J Neurosci
    volume: 33
    issue: 19
    pages: 8237-42
    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a slow onset, so it is challenging to
      distinguish brain changes in healthy elderly persons from incipient AD.
      One-year brain changes with a distinct frontotemporal pattern have been
      shown in older adults. However, it is not clear to what extent these
      changes may have been affected by undetected, early AD. To address this,
      we estimated 1-year atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 132
      healthy elderly persons who had remained free of diagnosed mild cognitive
      impairment or AD for at least 3 years. We found significant volumetric
      reductions throughout the brain. The sample was further divided into
      low-risk groups based on clinical, biomarker, genetic, or cognitive
      criteria. Although sample sizes varied, significant reductions were
      observed in all groups, with rates and topographical distribution of
      atrophy comparable to that of the full sample. Volume reductions were
      especially pronounced in the default mode network, closely matching the
      previously described frontotemporal pattern of changes in healthy aging.
      Atrophy in the hippocampus predicted change in memory, with no additional
      default mode network contributions. In conclusion, reductions in regional
      brain volumes can be detected over the course of 1 year even in older
      adults who are unlikely to be in a presymptomatic stage of AD.

      GWAS of Cerebrospinal Fluid Tau Levels Identifies Risk Variants for
      Alzheimer s Disease
    journal: Neuron
    volume: 78

    pages: 256-268
    abstract: >-
      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau),
      and Aβ42 are established biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and have
      been used as quantitative traits for genetic analyses. We performed the
      largest genome-wide association study for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      tau/ptau levels published to date (n = 1,269), identifying three
      genome-wide significant loci for CSF tau and ptau: rs9877502 (p = 4.89 ×
      10−9 for tau) located at 3q28 between GEMC1 and OSTN, rs514716 (p = 1.07 ×
      10−8 and p = 3.22 × 10−9 for tau and ptau, respectively), located at
      9p24.2 within GLIS3 and rs6922617 (p = 3.58 × 10−8 for CSF ptau) at 6p21.1
      within the TREM gene cluster, a region recently reported to harbor rare
      variants that increase AD risk. In independent data sets, rs9877502 showed
      a strong association with risk for AD, tangle pathology, and global
      cognitive decline (p = 2.67 × 10−4, 0.039, 4.86 × 10−5, respectively)
      illustrating how this endophenotype-based approach can be used to identify
      new AD risk loci.

      Impaired default network functional connectivity in autosomal dominant
      Alzheimer disease
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 81
    issue: 8
    pages: 736-744
    abstract: >-
      Objective: To investigate default mode network (DMN) functional
      connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in a large cross-sectional cohort of subjects
      from families harboring pathogenic presenilin-1 (PSEN1), presenilin- 2
      (PSEN2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP)mutations participating in the
      Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network. Methods: Eighty-three mutation
      carriers and 37 asymptomatic noncarriers from the same families underwent
      fMRI during resting state at 8 centers in the United States, United
      Kingdom, and Australia. Using group-independent component analysis, fcMRI
      was compared using mutation status and Clinical Dementia Rating to
      stratify groups, and related to each participant’s estimated years from
      expected symptom onset (eYO). Results: We observed significantly decreased
      DMN fcMRI in mutation carriers with increasing Clinical Dementia Rating,
      most evident in the precuneus/posterior cingulate and parietal cortices (p
      , 0.001). Comparison of asymptomatic mutation carriers with noncarriers
      demonstrated decreased fcMRI in the precuneus/posterior cingulate (p 5
      0.014) and right parietal cortex (p 5 0.0016). We observed a significant
      interaction between mutation carrier status and eYO, with decreases in DMN
      fcMRI observed as mutation carriers approached and surpassed their eYO.
      Conclusion: Functional disruption of the DMN occurs early in the course of
      autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease, beginning before clinically evident
      symptoms, and worsening with increased impairment. These findings suggest
      that DMN fcMRI may prove useful as a biomarker across a wide spectrum of
      disease, and support the feasibility of DMN fcMRI as a secondary endpoint
      in upcoming multicenter clinical trials in Alzheimer disease.

      A genome-wide study shows a limited contribution of rare copy number
      variants to Alzheimer's disease risk
    journal: Human Molecular Genetics
    volume: 22
    issue: 4
    pages: 816-824
    abstract: >-
      We assessed the role of rare copy number variants (CNVs) in Alzheimer’s
      disease (AD) using intensity data from 3260 AD cases and 1290 age-matched
      controls from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted by the
      Genetic and Environmental Risk for Alzheimer’s disease Consortium (GERAD).
      We did not observe a significant excess of rare CNVs in cases, although we
      did identify duplications overlapping APP and CR1 which may be pathogenic.
      We looked for an excess of CNVs in loci which have been highlighted in
      previous AD CNV studies, but did not replicate previous findings. Through
      pathway analyses, we observed suggestive evidence for biological overlap
      between single nucleotide polymorphisms and CNVs in AD susceptibility. We
      also identified that our sample of elderly controls harbours significantly
      fewer deletions &#62;1 Mb than younger control sets in previous CNV
      studies on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (P 5 8.9 3 1024 and 0.024,
      respectively), raising the possibility that healthy elderly individuals
      have a reduced rate of large deletions. Thus, in contrast to diseases such
      as schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
      CNVs do not appear to make a significant contribution to the development
      of AD.

      Mapping the Genetic Variation of Regional Brain Volumes as Explained by

    abstract: >-
      &#60;p&#62;Typically twin studies are used to investigate the aggregate
      effects of genetic and environmental influences on brain phenotypic
      measures. Although some phenotypic measures are highly heritable in twin
      studies, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) identified by genome-wide
      association studies (GWAS) account for only a small fraction of the
      heritability of these measures. We mapped the genetic variation (the
      proportion of phenotypic variance explained by variation among SNPs) of
      volumes of pre-defined regions across the whole brain, as explained by
      512,905 SNPs genotyped on 747 adult participants from the Alzheimer's
      Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found that 85% of the variance
      of intracranial volume (ICV) (p = 0.04) was explained by considering all
      SNPs simultaneously, and after adjusting for ICV, total grey matter (GM)
      and white matter (WM) volumes had genetic variation estimates near zero
      (p = 0.5). We found varying estimates of genetic variation across 93
      non-overlapping regions, with asymmetry in estimates between the left and
      right cerebral hemispheres. Several regions reported in previous studies
      to be related to Alzheimer's disease progression were estimated to have a
      large proportion of volumetric variance explained by the SNPs.&#60;/p&#62;

    abstract: >-
      To identify loci associated with Alzheimer disease, we conducted a
      three-stage analysis using existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
      and genotyping in a new sample. In Stage I, all suggestive
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (at P&#60;0.001) in a previously reported
      GWAS of seven independent studies (8082 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cases;
      12 040 controls) were selected, and in Stage II these were examined in an
      in silico analysis within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in
      Genomic Epidemiology consortium GWAS (1367 cases and 12904 controls). Six
      novel signals reaching P&#60;5 × 10−6 were genotyped in an independent
      Stage III sample (the Fundació ACE data set) of 2200 sporadic AD patients
      and 2301 controls. We identified a novel association with AD in the
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F0
      (ATP5H)/Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 2
      (KCTD2) locus, which reached genome-wide significance in the combined

      Regional variability of imaging biomarkers in autosomal dominant
      Alzheimer’s disease
    journal: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
    volume: 110
    issue: 47
    pages: E4502-E4509
    abstract: >-
      Major imaging biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease include amyloid deposition
      [imaged with [11C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET], altered glucose
      metabolism (imaged with [18F]fluro-deoxyglucose PET), and structural
      atrophy (imaged by MRI). Recently we published the initial subset of
      imaging findings for specific regions in a cohort of individuals with
      autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease. We now extend this work to include
      a larger cohort, whole-brain analyses integrating all three imaging
      modalities, and longitudinal data to examine regional differences in
      imaging biomarker dynamics. The anatomical distribution of imaging
      biomarkers is described in relation to estimated years from symptom onset.
      Autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease mutation carrier individuals have
      elevated PiB levels in nearly every cortical region 15 y before the
      estimated age of onset. Reduced cortical glucose metabolism and cortical
      thinning in the medial and lateral parietal lobe appeared 10 and 5 y,
      respectively, before estimated age of onset. Importantly, however, a
      divergent pattern was observed subcortically. All subcortical gray-matter
      regions exhibited elevated PiB uptake, but despite this, only the
      hippocampus showed reduced glucose metabolism. Similarly, atrophy was not
      observed in the caudate and pallidum despite marked amyloid accumulation.
      Finally, before hypometabolism, a hypermetabolic phase was identified for
      some cortical regions, including the precuneus and posterior cingulate.
      Additional analyses of individuals in which longitudinal data were
      available suggested that an accelerated appearance of volumetric declines
      approximately coincides with the onset of the symptomatic phase of the
      disease.

      The PSEN1, p.E318G Variant Increases the Risk of Alzheimer's Disease in

      &#60;title&#62;Author Summary&#60;/title&#62;&#60;p&#62;Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting more
      than 5.3 million people in the US. AD-causing mutations have been
      identified in &#60;italic&#62;APP&#60;/italic&#62;,
      &#60;italic&#62;PSEN1&#60;/italic&#62; and
      &#60;italic&#62;PSEN2&#60;/italic&#62; genes. Heterozygous carriers of
      &#60;italic&#62;APOE&#60;/italic&#62;-ε4 allele exhibit a 3-fold increased
      risk for developing AD, while homozygous carriers show a 10-fold greater
      risk than non-carriers. Here, we sequenced individuals with extreme levels
      of well-established AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in order to
      identify variants in &#60;italic&#62;APOE, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2,
      GRN&#60;/italic&#62; and &#60;italic&#62;MAPT&#60;/italic&#62; genes
      associated with AD risk. This approach allowed us to identify known
      pathogenic variants, additional AD risk genetic factors and identify a low
      frequency variant in &#60;italic&#62;PSEN1&#60;/italic&#62;, p.E318G
      (rs17125721-G) that increases risk for AD in a gene-gene interaction with
      &#60;italic&#62;APOE&#60;/italic&#62;. These findings were replicated in
      three large (&gt;4,000 individuals) and independent datasets. This finding
      is particularly important because we demonstrated that a currently
      considered non-pathogenic variant is associated with higher levels of
      neuronal degeneration, and with Aβ deposition, more Aβ plaques and faster
      cognitive decline in an &#60;italic&#62;APOE&#60;/italic&#62;-ε4-dependent
      fashion. &#60;italic&#62;APOE&#60;/italic&#62;-ε4 heterozygous individuals
      who carry this variant are at similar AD risk as
      &#60;italic&#62;APOE&#60;/italic&#62;-ε4 homozygous
      individuals.&#60;/p&#62;

    title: Exceptional memory performance in the Long Life Family Study (LLFS)

    pages: 2445-2448
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Research to understand variability at the highest end of the
      cognitive performance distribution has been scarce. Our aim was to define
      a cognitive endophenotype based on exceptional episodic memory performance
      (EM) and to investigate familial aggregation of EM in families from the
      Long Life Family Study. METHODS: Using a sample of 1911 non-demented
      offspring of long-lived probands, we created a quantitative phenotype, EM
      (memory z-score &#62;= 1.5), and classified LLFS families as EM and Non-EM
      families based on the number of EM offspring. We then assessed differences
      in memory performance between LLFS relatives in the parental generation of
      EM families and those in Non-EM families using multivariate analysis
      adjusted for APOE genotype. RESULTS: LLFS relatives in the proband
      generation from EM families showed better episodic memory performance than
      those from Non-EM families (β=0.74, SE=0.19, p =1.4 × 10(-4)).
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that there is a familial correlation of the
      EM endophenotype, suggesting that genetic variants might influence memory
      performance in long-lived families.

      Brain expression genome-wide association study (eGWAS) identifies human
      disease-associated variants
    journal: PLoS Genet
    volume: 8
    issue: 6
    pages: e1002707
    abstract: >-
      Genetic variants that modify brain gene expression may also influence risk
      for human diseases. We measured expression levels of 24,526 transcripts in
      brain samples from the cerebellum and temporal cortex of autopsied
      subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD, cerebellar n=197, temporal cortex
      n=202) and with other brain pathologies (non-AD, cerebellar n=177,
      temporal cortex n=197). We conducted an expression genome-wide association
      study (eGWAS) using 213,528 cisSNPs within +/- 100 kb of the tested
      transcripts. We identified 2,980 cerebellar cisSNP/transcript level
      associations (2,596 unique cisSNPs) significant in both ADs and non-ADs
      (q&#60;0.05, p=7.70 x 10(-5)-1.67 x 10(-82)). Of these, 2,089 were also
      significant in the temporal cortex (p=1.85 x 10(-5)-1.70 x 10(-141)). The
      top cerebellar cisSNPs had 2.4-fold enrichment for human
      disease-associated variants (p&#60;10(-6)). We identified novel
      cisSNP/transcript associations for human disease-associated variants,
      including progressive supranuclear palsy SLCO1A2/rs11568563, Parkinson's
      disease (PD) MMRN1/rs6532197, Paget's disease OPTN/rs1561570; and we
      confirmed others, including PD MAPT/rs242557, systemic lupus erythematosus
      and ulcerative colitis IRF5/rs4728142, and type 1 diabetes mellitus
      RPS26/rs1701704. In our eGWAS, there was 2.9-3.3 fold enrichment
      (p&#60;10(-6)) of significant cisSNPs with suggestive AD-risk association
      (p&#60;10(-3)) in the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium GWAS. These
      results demonstrate the significant contributions of genetic factors to
      human brain gene expression, which are reliably detected across different
      brain regions and pathologies. The significant enrichment of brain cisSNPs
      among disease-associated variants advocates gene expression changes as a
      mechanism for many central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS diseases.
      Combined assessment of expression and disease GWAS may provide
      complementary information in discovery of human disease variants with
      functional implications. Our findings have implications for the design and
      interpretation of eGWAS in general and the use of brain expression
      quantitative trait loci in the study of human disease genetics.

    title: Investigation of C9orf72 in 4 Neurodegenerative Disorders
    journal: Archives of Neurology
    volume: 69
    issue: 12
    pages: 1583-1590
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate the allele frequency of C9orf72 (G(4)C(2)) repeats
      in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration
      (FTLD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and Parkinson disease (PD). DESIGN: The
      number of repeats was estimated by a 2-step genotyping strategy. For
      expansion carriers, we sequenced the repeat flanking regions and obtained
      APOE genotypes and MAPT H1/H2 haplotypes. SETTING: Hospitals specializing
      in neurodegenerative disorders. SUBJECTS: We analyzed 520 patients with
      FTLD, 389 patients with ALS, 424 patients with AD, 289 patients with PD,
      602 controls, 18 families, and 29 patients with PD with the LRRK2 G2019S
      mutation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The expansion frequency. RESULTS: Based on
      a prior cutoff (&#62;30 repeats), the expansion was detected in 9.3% of
      patients with ALS, 5.2% of patients with FTLD, and 0.7% of patients with
      PD but not in controls or patients with AD. It was significantly
      associated with family history of ALS or FTLD and age at onset of FTLD.
      Phenotype variation (ALS vs FTLD) was not associated with MAPT, APOE, or
      variability in the repeat flanking regions. Two patients with PD were
      carriers of 39 and 32 repeats with questionable pathological significance,
      since the 39-repeat allele does not segregate with PD. No expansion or
      intermediate alleles (20–29 repeats) were found among the G2019S carriers
      and AD cases with TAR DNA-binding protein 43–positive inclusions.
      Surprisingly, the frequency of the 10-repeat allele was marginally
      increased in all 4 neurodegenerative diseases compared with controls,
      indicating the presence of an unknown risk variation in the C9orf72 locus.
      CONCLUSIONS: The C9orf72 expansion is a common cause of ALS and FTLD, but
      not of AD or PD. Our study raises concern about a reliable cutoff for the
      pathological repeat number, which is important in the utility of genetic
      screening.

      Common genetic variants in the CLDN2 and PRSS1-PRSS2 loci alter risk for
      alcohol-related and sporadic pancreatitis
    journal: Nat Genet
    volume: 44
    issue: 12
    pages: 1349-54
    abstract: >-
      Pancreatitis is a complex, progressively destructive inflammatory
      disorder. Alcohol was long thought to be the primary causative agent, but
      genetic contributions have been of interest since the discovery that rare
      PRSS1, CFTR and SPINK1 variants were associated with pancreatitis risk. We
      now report two associations at genome-wide significance identified and
      replicated at PRSS1-PRSS2 (P &#60; 1 x 10(-12)) and X-linked CLDN2 (P
      &#60; 1 x 10(-21)) through a two-stage genome-wide study (stage 1: 676
      cases and 4,507 controls; stage 2: 910 cases and 4,170 controls). The
      PRSS1 variant likely affects disease susceptibility by altering expression
      of the primary trypsinogen gene. The CLDN2 risk allele is associated with
      atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. The
      homozygous (or hemizygous in males) CLDN2 genotype confers the greatest
      risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk.
      These results could partially explain the high frequency of
      alcohol-related pancreatitis in men (male hemizygote frequency is 0.26,
      whereas female homozygote frequency is 0.07).

      Amyloid imaging with [(11) C]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) provides in vivo
      data on plaque deposition in those with, or at risk for, Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). We performed a gene-based association analysis of 15
      quality-controlled amyloid-pathway associated candidate genes in 103
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants. The mean
      normalized PiB uptake value across four brain regions known to have
      amyloid deposition in AD was used as a quantitative phenotype. The minor
      allele of an intronic SNP within DHCR24 was identified and associated with
      a lower average PiB uptake. Further investigation at whole-brain
      voxel-wise level indicated that non-carriers of the minor allele had
      higher PiB uptake in frontal regions compared to carriers. DHCR24 has been
      previously shown to confer resistance against beta-amyloid and oxidative
      stress-induced apoptosis, thus our findings support a neuroprotective
      role. Pathway-based genetic analysis of targeted molecular imaging
      phenotypes appears promising to help elucidate disease pathophysiology and
      identify potential therapeutic targets.

      Analysis of copy number variation in Alzheimer's disease: the NIALOAD/

      Copy number variants (CNVs) are DNA regions that have gains (duplications)
      or losses (deletions) of genetic material. CNVs may encompass a single
      gene or multiple genes and can affect their function. They are
      hypothesized to play an important role in certain diseases. We previously
      examined the role of CNVs in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) using participants from the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and identified gene regions
      overlapped by CNVs only in cases (AD and/or MCI) but not in controls.
      Using a similar approach as ADNI, we investigated the role of CNVs using
      794 AD and 196 neurologically evaluated control non-Hispanic Caucasian
      NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD Family Study participants with DNA derived from
      blood/brain tissue. The controls had no family history of AD and were
      unrelated to AD participants. CNV calls were generated and analyzed after
      detailed quality review. 711 AD cases and 171 controls who passed all
      quality thresholds were included in case/control association analyses,
      focusing on candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. We identified genes
      overlapped by CNV calls only in AD cases but not controls. A trend for
      lower CNV call rate was observed for deletions as well as duplications in
      cases compared to controls. Gene-based association analyses confirmed
      previous findings in the ADNI study (ATXN1, HLA-DPB1, RELN, DOPEY2, GSTT1,
      CHRFAM7A, ERBB4, NRXN1) and identified a new gene (IMMP2L) that may play a
      role in AD susceptibility. Replication in independent samples as well as
      further analyses of these gene regions is warranted.

      Analysis of Copy Number Variation in Alzheimer’s Disease in a Cohort of
      Clinically Characterized and Neuropathologically Verified Individuals

      &#60;p&#62;Copy number variations (CNVs) are genomic regions that have
      added (duplications) or deleted (deletions) genetic material. They may
      overlap genes affecting their function and have been shown to be
      associated with disease. We previously investigated the role of CNVs in
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment using
      Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and National Institute
      of Aging-Late Onset AD/National Cell Repository for AD (NIA-AD FBS/NCRAD)
      Family Study participants, and identified a number of genes overlapped by
      CNV calls. To confirm the findings and identify other potential candidate
      regions, we analyzed array data from a unique cohort of 1617 Caucasian
      participants (1022 AD cases and 595 controls) who were clinically
      characterized and whose diagnosis was neuropathologically verified. All
      DNA samples were extracted from brain tissue. CNV calls were generated and
      subjected to quality control (QC). 728 cases and 438 controls who passed
      all QC measures were included in case/control association analyses
      including candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. Rates of deletions
      and duplications did not significantly differ between cases and controls.
      Case-control association identified a number of previously reported
      regions (&#60;italic&#62;CHRFAM7A&#60;/italic&#62;,
      &#60;italic&#62;RELN&#60;/italic&#62; and
      &#60;italic&#62;DOPEY2&#60;/italic&#62;) as well as a new gene
      (&#60;italic&#62;HLA-DRA&#60;/italic&#62;). Meta-analysis of
      &#60;italic&#62;CHRFAM7A&#60;/italic&#62; indicated a significant
      association of the gene with AD and/or MCI risk
      (&#60;italic&#62;P&#60;/italic&#62; = 0.006, odds ratio = 3.986 (95%
      confidence interval 1.490–10.667)). A novel
      &#60;italic&#62;APP&#60;/italic&#62; gene duplication was observed in one
      case sample. Further investigation of the identified genes in independent
      and larger samples is warranted.&#60;/p&#62;

      Identification of common variants associated with human hippocampal and
      intracranial volumes
    journal: Nat Genet
    volume: 44
    issue: 5
    pages: 552-61
    abstract: >-
      Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures may reveal
      new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and neuropsychiatric
      illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient
      Alzheimer's disease and is reduced in schizophrenia, major depression and
      mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are
      highly heritable, identifying and replicating genetic influences has been
      difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide
      association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal,
      total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational
      consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with
      hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 x 10(-16)) and the
      expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue.
      Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with
      intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 x 10(-12)). We also
      identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373
      within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 x 10(-7)).

      Genetic variants influencing human aging from late-onset Alzheimer’s
      disease (LOAD) genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
    journal: Neurobiology of Aging
    volume: 33
    issue: 8
    pages: 1849.e5-1849.18
    abstract: >-
      Genetics plays a crucial role in human aging with up to 30% of those
      living to the mid-80s being determined by genetic variation. Survival to
      older ages likely entails an even greater genetic contribution. There is
      increasing evidence that genes implicated in age-related diseases, such as
      cancer and neuronal disease, play a role in affecting human life span. We
      have selected the 10 most promising late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD)
      susceptibility genes identified through several recent large genome-wide
      association studies (GWAS). These 10 LOAD genes (APOE, CLU, PICALM, CR1,
      BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A6A, CD33, CD2AP, and EPHA1) have been tested for
      association with human aging in our dataset (1385 samples with documented
      age at death [AAD], age range: 58–108 years; mean age at death: 80.2)
      using the most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in
      the previous studies. Apart from the APOE locus (rs2075650) which showed
      compelling evidence of association with risk on human life span (p = 5.27
      × 10(−4)), none of the other LOAD gene loci demonstrated significant
      evidence of association. In addition to examining the known LOAD genes, we
      carried out analyses using age at death as a quantitative trait. No
      genome-wide significant SNPs were discovered. Increasing sample size and
      statistical power will be imperative to detect genuine aging-associated
      variants in the future. In this report, we also discuss issues relating to
      the analysis of genome-wide association studies data from different
      centers and the bioinformatic approach required to distinguish spurious
      genome-wide significant signals from real SNP associations.

    abstract: >-
      Here we review the genetic causes and risks for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
      Early work identified mutations in three genes that cause AD: APP, PSEN1
      and PSEN2. Although mutations in these genes are rare causes of AD, their
      discovery had a major impact on our understanding of molecular mechanisms
      of AD. Early work also revealed the ε4 allele of the APOE as a strong risk
      factor for AD. Subsequently, SORL1 also was identified as an AD risk gene.
      More recently, advances in our knowledge of the human genome, made
      possible by technological advances and methods to analyze genomic data,
      permit systematic identification of genes that contribute to AD risk. This
      work, so far accomplished through single nucleotide polymorphism arrays,
      has revealed nine new genes implicated in AD risk (ABCA7, BIN1, CD33,
      CD2AP, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, MS4A4E/MS4A6A, and PICALM). We review the
      relationship between these mutations and genetic variants and the
      neuropathologic features of AD and related disorders. Together, these
      discoveries point toward a new era in neurodegenerative disease research
      that impacts not only AD but also related illnesses that produce cognitive
      and behavioral deficits.

      Genetic variants in the Fat and Obesity Associated (FTO) gene and risk of
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: PLoS One
    volume: 7
    issue: 12
    pages: e50354
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Recent studies showed that polymorphisms in the Fat and
      Obesity-Associated (FTO) gene have robust effects on obesity,
      obesity-related traits and endophenotypes associated with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). METHODS: We used 1,877 Caucasian cases and controls from the
      NIA-AD FBS study and 1,093 Caribbean Hispanics to further explore the
      association of FTO with AD. Using logistic regression, we assessed 42 SNPs
      in introns 1 and 2, the region previously reported to be associated with
      AD endophenotypes, which had been derived by genome-wide screenings. In
      addition, we performed gene expression analyses of neuropathologically
      confirmed AD cases and controls of two independent datasets (19 AD cases,
      10 controls; 176 AD cases, 188 controls) using within- and between-group
      factors ANOVA of log(10) transformed rank invariant normalized expression
      data. RESULTS: In the NIALOAD study, one SNP was significantly associated
      with AD and three additional markers were close to significance
      (rs6499640, rs10852521, rs16945088, rs8044769, FDR p-value:
      0.05&#60;p&#60;0.09). Two of the SNPs are in strong LD (D'&#62;0.9) with
      the previously reported SNPs. In the Caribbean Hispanic dataset, we
      identified three SNPs (rs17219084, rs11075996, rs11075997, FDR p-value:
      0.009&#60;p&#60;0.01) that were associated with AD. These results were
      confirmed by haplotype analyses and in a metaanalysis in which we included
      the ADNI dataset. FTO had a significantly lower expresssion in AD cases
      compared to controls in two independent datasets derived from human cortex
      and amygdala tissue, respectively (p = 2.18 x 10-5 and p&#60;0.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the notion that genetic variation in Introns
      1 and 2 of the FTO gene may contribute to AD risk.

    title: Effect of Genetic Variation in LRRTM3 on Risk of Alzheimer Disease
    journal: Archives of Neurology
    volume: 69
    issue: 7
    pages: 894-900
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 3
      (LRRTM3) in late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) by independent genetic
      epidemiologic and functional studies. METHODS: First, we explored
      associations between LRRTM3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and AD in the
      National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease case-control
      data set (993 patients and 884 control subjects) and a cohort of Caribbean
      Hispanics (549 patients and 544 controls) using single-marker and
      haplo-type analyses. Then we explored the effect of LRRTM3 small-hairpin
      RNAs on amyloid precursor protein processing. RESULTS: One
      single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region (rs16923760; C
      allele: odds ratio,−0.74, P=.03), and a block of 4 single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms in intron 2 (rs1925608, C allele: 0.84, P=.04; rs7082306, A
      allele: 0.75, P=.04; rs1925609, T allele: 1.2, P=.03; and rs10997477, T
      allele: 0.88, P=.05) were associated with AD in the National Institute on
      Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease data set or the Caribbean His-panic
      data set. The corresponding haplotypes were also associated with AD risk
      (.01&#60; P&#60;.05). In addition, LRRTM3 knockdown with small-hairpin
      RNAs caused a significant decrease in amyloid precursor protein processing
      (P&#60;.05 to P&#60;.01) compared with the scrambled small-hairpin RNA
      condition. CONCLUSIONS: These complementary findings support the notions
      that genetic variation in LRRTM3 is associated with AD risk and that
      LRRTM3 may modulate γ-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein.
      Additional studies are needed to determine whether the specific alleles
      associated with differential risk for AD indeed confer this risk through
      an effect of LRRTM3 expression levels that in turn modulates amyloid
      precursor protein processing.

      OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association (GWAS) methods have identified genes
      contributing to Parkinson's disease (PD); we sought to identify additional
      genes associated with PD susceptibility. METHODS: A 2-stage design was
      used. First, individual level genotypic data from 5 recent PD GWAS
      (Discovery Sample: 4,238 PD cases and 4,239 controls) were combined.
      Following imputation, a logistic regression model was employed in each
      dataset to test for association with PD susceptibility and results from
      each dataset were meta-analyzed. Second, 768 single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in an independent Replication Sample
      (3,738 cases and 2,111 controls). RESULTS: Genome-wide significance was
      reached for SNPs in SNCA (rs356165; G: odds ratio [OR]=1.37;
      p=9.3x10(-21)), MAPT (rs242559; C: OR=0.78; p=1.5x10(-10)), GAK/DGKQ
      (rs11248051; T: OR=1.35; p=8.2x10(-9)/rs11248060; T: OR=1.35;
      p=2.0x10(-9)), and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region (rs3129882; A:
      OR=0.83; p=1.2x10(-8)), which were previously reported. The Replication
      Sample confirmed the associations with SNCA, MAPT, and the HLA region and
      also with GBA (E326K; OR=1.71; p=5x10(-8) Combined Sample) (N370; OR=3.08;
      p=7x10(-5) Replication sample). A novel PD susceptibility locus, RIT2, on
      chromosome 18 (rs12456492; p=5x10(-5) Discovery Sample; p=1.52x10(-7)
      Replication sample; p=2x10(-10) Combined Sample) was replicated.
      Conditional analyses within each of the replicated regions identified
      distinct SNP associations within GBA and SNCA, suggesting that there may
      be multiple risk alleles within these genes. INTERPRETATION: We identified
      a novel PD susceptibility locus, RIT2, replicated several previously
      identified loci, and identified more than 1 risk allele within SNCA and
      GBA.

      Multiple loci influencing hippocampal degeneration identified by genome

    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: Large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified
      many novel genes influencing Alzheimer disease (AD) risk, but most of the
      genetic variance remains unexplained. We conducted a 2-stage GWAS for
      AD-related quantitative measures of hippocampal volume (HV), total
      cerebral volume (TCV), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). METHODS:
      Brain magnetic resonance imaging measures of HV, TCV, and WMH were
      obtained from 981 Caucasian and 419 African American AD cases and their
      cognitively normal siblings in the MIRAGE (Multi Institutional Research in
      Alzheimer's Genetic Epidemiology) Study, and from 168 AD cases, 336
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 188 controls in the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Study. A GWAS for each trait
      was conducted in the 2 Caucasian data sets in stage 1. Results from the 2
      data sets were combined by meta-analysis. In stage 2, 1 single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) from each region that was nominally significant in each
      data set (p &#60; 0.05) and strongly associated in both data sets (p &#60;
      1.0 x 10(-5)) was evaluated in the African American data set. RESULTS:
      Twenty-two markers (14 for HV, 3 for TCV, and 5 for WMH) from distinct
      regions met criteria for evaluation in stage 2. Novel genome-wide
      significant associations (p &#60; 5.0 x 10(-8)) were attained for HV with
      SNPs in the APOE, F5/SELP, LHFP, and GCFC2 gene regions. All of these
      associations were supported by evidence in each data set. Associations
      with different SNPs in the same gene (p &#60; 1 x 10(-5) in Caucasians and
      p &#60; 2.2 x 10(-4) in African Americans) were also observed for PICALM
      with HV, SYNPR with TCV, and TTC27 with WMH. INTERPRETATION: Our study
      demonstrates the efficacy of endophenotypes for broadening our
      understanding of the genetic basis of AD.

      The global prevalence of dementia has been estimated to be as high as 24
      million, and is predicted to double every 20 years until at least 2040. As
      the population worldwide continues to age, the number of individuals at
      risk will also increase, particularly among the very old. Alzheimer
      disease is the leading cause of dementia beginning with impaired memory.
      The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease include diffuse and
      neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques in brain that are frequently
      surrounded by dystrophic neurites and intraneuronal neurofibrillary
      tangles. The etiology of Alzheimer disease remains unclear, but it is
      likely to be the result of both genetic and environmental factors. In this
      review we discuss the prevalence and incidence rates, the established
      environmental risk factors, and the protective factors, and briefly review
      genetic variants predisposing to disease.

      Integrated copy number and gene expression analysis detects a CREB1

      Genetic variation, both single-nucleotide variations and copy number
      variations (CNV), contribute to changes in gene expression. In some cases
      these variations are meaningfully correlated with disease states. We
      hypothesized that in a genetically heterogeneous disorder such as sporadic
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), utilizing gene expression as a quantitative
      trait and CNVs as a genetic marker map within the same individuals in the
      context of case-control status may increase the power to detect relevant
      loci. Using this approach an 8-kb deletion was identified that contains a
      PAX6-binding site on chr2q33.3 upstream of CREB1 encoding the cAMP
      responsive element-binding protein1 transcription factor. The association
      of the CNV to AD was confirmed by a case-control association study
      consisting of the Texas Alzheimer Research and Care Consortium and NIA-AD
      FBS Family Study data sets.

      Discovery and Replication of Gene Influences on Brain Structure Using

    abstract: >-
      We implemented least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)
      regression to evaluate gene effects in genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS) of brain images, using an MRI-derived temporal lobe volume measure
      from 729 subjects scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI). Sparse groups of SNPs in individual genes were selected
      by LASSO, which identifies efficient sets of variants influencing the
      data. These SNPs were considered jointly when assessing their association
      with neuroimaging measures. We discovered 22 genes that passed genome-wide
      significance for influencing temporal lobe volume. This was a
      substantially greater number of significant genes compared to those found
      with standard, univariate GWAS. These top genes are all expressed in the
      brain and include genes previously related to brain function or
      neuropsychiatric disorders such as MACROD2, SORCS2, GRIN2B, MAGI2, NPAS3,
      CLSTN2, GABRG3, NRXN3, PRKAG2, GAS7, RBFOX1, ADARB2, CHD4, and CDH13. The
      top genes we identified with this method also displayed significant and
      widespread post hoc effects on voxelwise, tensor-based morphometry (TBM)
      maps of the temporal lobes. The most significantly associated gene was an
      autism susceptibility gene known as MACROD2. We were able to successfully
      replicate the effect of the MACROD2 gene in an independent cohort of 564
      young, Australian healthy adult twins and siblings scanned with MRI (mean
      age: 23.8 +/- 2.2 SD years). Our approach powerfully complements
      univariate techniques in detecting influences of genes on the living
      brain.

    abstract: >-
      In addition to apolipoprotein E (APOE), recent large genome-wide
      association studies (GWASs) have identified nine other genes/loci (CR1,
      BIN1, CLU, PICALM, MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7) for
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, the genetic effect
      attributable to known loci is about 50%, indicating that additional risk
      genes for LOAD remain to be identified. In this study, we have used a new
      GWAS data set from the University of Pittsburgh (1291 cases and 938
      controls) to examine in detail the recently implicated nine new regions
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and also performed a meta-analysis
      utilizing the top 1% GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with
      P&#60;0.01 along with four independent data sets (2727 cases and 3336
      controls) for these SNPs in an effort to identify new AD loci. The new
      GWAS data were generated on the Illumina Omni1-Quad chip and imputed at
      ~2.5 million markers. As expected, several markers in the APOE regions
      showed genome-wide significant associations in the Pittsburg sample. While
      we observed nominal significant associations (P&#60;0.05) either within or
      adjacent to five genes (PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A4/MS4A6E and EPHA1),
      significant signals were observed 69-180 kb outside of the remaining four
      genes (CD33, CLU, CD2AP and CR1). Meta-analysis on the top 1% SNPs
      revealed a suggestive novel association in the PPP1R3B gene (top SNP
      rs3848140 with P = 3.05E-07). The association of this SNP with AD risk was
      consistent in all five samples with a meta-analysis odds ratio of 2.43.
      This is a potential candidate gene for AD as this is expressed in the
      brain and is involved in lipid metabolism. These findings need to be
      confirmed in additional samples.

    abstract: >-
      The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly determined by genetic
      factors and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified
      several genes for the disease risk. In addition to the disease risk,
      age-at-onset (AAO) of AD has also strong genetic component with an
      estimated heritability of 42%. Identification of AAO genes may help to
      understand the biological mechanisms that regulate the onset of the
      disease. Here we report the first GWAS focused on identifying genes for
      the AAO of AD. We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis on three samples
      comprising a total of 2222 AD cases. A total of approximately 2.5 million
      directly genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
      analyzed in relation to AAO of AD. As expected, the most significant
      associations were observed in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) region on
      chromosome 19 where several SNPs surpassed the conservative genome-wide
      significant threshold (P&#60;5E-08). The most significant SNP outside the
      APOE region was located in the DCHS2 gene on chromosome 4q31.3 (rs1466662;
      P=4.95E-07). There were 19 additional significant SNPs in this region at
      P&#60;1E-04 and the DCHS2 gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex and
      thus is a potential candidate for affecting AAO in AD. These findings need
      to be confirmed in additional well-powered samples.Molecular Psychiatry

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of risk and age at onset (AAO) of
      Alzheimer disease (AD) with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
      chromosome 19 region including apolipoprotein E (APOE) and a repeat-length
      polymorphism in TOMM40 (poly-T, rs10524523). DESIGN: Conditional logistic
      regression models and survival analysis. SETTING: Fifteen genome-wide
      association study data sets assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics
      Consortium. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven thousand eight hundred forty AD cases and
      10 931 cognitively normal elderly controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Association of AD risk and AAO with genotyped and imputed SNPs located in
      an 800-Mb region including APOE in the entire Alzheimer's Disease Genetics
      Consortium data set and with the TOMM40 poly-T marker genotyped in a
      subset of 1256 cases and 1605 controls. RESULTS: In models adjusting for
      APOE epsilon4, no SNPs in the entire region were significantly associated
      with AAO at P.001. Rs10524523 was not significantly associated with AD or
      AAO in models adjusting for APOE genotype or within the subset of
      epsilon3/epsilon3 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: APOE alleles epsilon2, epsilon3,
      and epsilon4 account for essentially all the inherited risk of AD
      associated with this region. Other variants including a poly-T track in
      TOMM40 are not independent risk or AAO loci.

      BACKGROUND & AIMS: We studied the relationship between IL28B gene-related
      SNP rs12979860 and early viral kinetics (day 0–28) during peginterferon
      and ribavirin treatment, in 173 African Americans (AA) and 188 Caucasian
      Americans (CA) with HCV genotype 1. METHODS: We studied the relationship
      between IL28B 16 gene-related SNP rs12979860 and early viral kinetics (day
      0–28) 17 during peginterferon and ribavirin treatment, in 171 African 18
      Americans (AA) and 188 Caucasian Americans (CA) with HCV 19 genotype 1.
      RESULTS: Compared to non-C/C genotypes, C/C was associated with greater
      declines in serum HCV RNA during phase 1 (day 0–2), phase 2 (day 7–28),
      and day 0–28 and higher response (undetected HCV RNA) rates at weeks 4 and
      12 in AA and CA. A static phase and increases in HCV RNA from day 2 to 7
      were more common in patients with non-C/C genotypes. C/C was also
      associated with higher week 24, 48, and 72 response rates in CA (p
      &#60;0.01) but not in AA. At baseline, SNP genotype was the only
      independent predictor of phase 1; SNP genotype and phase 1 were
      independent predictors of phase 2 (p&#60;0.001). There were no racial
      differences in HCV RNA declines during phase 1, day 2–7, phase 2, and day
      0–28 with the same SNP genotype. AA with C/C and C/T genotypes had lower
      week 24, 48, and 72 (SVR) rates than did CA (p = 0.03). SNP C/C predicted
      higher SVR rates in AA and CA with high baseline HCV RNA (≥ 600,000
      IU/ml), and in CA with ≥ 1 log(10) IU/ml decrease in HCV RNA from day 0 to

    title: Role of common and rare APP DNA sequence variants in Alzheimer disease
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 78
    issue: 16
    pages: 1250-7
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVES: More than 30 different rare mutations, including copy number
      variants (CNVs), in the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) cause
      early-onset familial Alzheimer disease (EOFAD), whereas the contribution
      of common APP variants to disease risk remains controversial. In this
      study we systematically assessed the role of both rare and common APP DNA
      variants in Alzheimer disease (AD) families. METHODS: Families with EOFAD
      genetically linked to the APP region were screened for missense mutations
      and locus duplications of APP. Further, using genome-wide DNA microarray
      data, we examined the APP locus for CNVs in a total of 797 additional
      early- and late-onset AD pedigrees. Finally, 423 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APP locus, including 2 promoter polymorphisms
      previously associated with AD risk, were tested in up to 4,200 individuals
      from multiplex AD families. RESULTS: Analyses of 8 21q21-linked families
      revealed one family carrying a nonsynonymous mutation in exon 17
      (Val717Leu) and another family with a partially penetrant 3.5-Mb locus
      duplication encompassing APP. CNV analysis in the APP locus revealed an
      additional family carrying a fully penetrant 380-kb duplication, merely
      spanning APP. Last, contrary to previous reports, association analyses of
      more than 400 different SNPs in or near APP failed to show significant
      effects on AD risk. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that APP mutations and
      locus duplications are a very rare cause of EOFAD and that the
      contribution of common APP variants to AD susceptibility is insignificant.
      Furthermore, duplications of APP may not be fully penetrant, possibly
      indicating the existence of hitherto unknown protective genetic factors.

      Genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease with psychotic
      symptoms
    journal: Mol Psychiatry
    volume: 17
    issue: 12
    pages: 1316-27
    abstract: >-
      Psychotic symptoms occur in ~40% of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      and are associated with more rapid cognitive decline and increased
      functional deficits. They show heritability up to 61% and have been
      proposed as a marker for a disease subtype suitable for gene mapping
      efforts. We undertook a combined analysis of three genome-wide association
      studies (GWASs) to identify loci that (1) increase susceptibility to an AD
      and subsequent psychotic symptoms; or (2) modify risk of psychotic
      symptoms in the presence of neurodegeneration caused by AD. In all, 1299
      AD cases with psychosis (AD+P), 735 AD cases without psychosis (AD-P) and
      5659 controls were drawn from Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD
      Consortium 1 (GERAD1), the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset
      Alzheimer's Disease (NIA-AD FBS) family study and the University of
      Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) GWASs. Unobserved
      genotypes were imputed to provide data on &#62;1.8 million
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Analyses in each data set were
      completed comparing (1) AD+P to AD-P cases, and (2) AD+P cases with
      controls (GERAD1, ADRC only). Aside from the apolipoprotein E (APOE)
      locus, the strongest evidence for association was observed in an
      intergenic region on chromosome 4 (rs753129; 'AD+PvAD-P' P=2.85 x 10(-7);
      'AD+PvControls' P=1.11 x 10(-4)). SNPs upstream of SLC2A9 (rs6834555,
      P=3.0 x 10(-7)) and within VSNL1 (rs4038131, P=5.9 x 10(-7)) showed
      strongest evidence for association with AD+P when compared with controls.
      These findings warrant further investigation in larger, appropriately
      powered samples in which the presence of psychotic symptoms in AD has been
      well characterized.

      Functional and genetic analysis of haplotypic sequence variation at the
      nicastrin genomic locus
    journal: Neurobiol Aging
    volume: 33
    issue: 8
    pages: 1848 e1-13
    abstract: >-
      Nicastrin (NCSTN) is a component of the gamma-secretase complex and
      therefore potentially a candidate risk gene for Alzheimer's disease. Here,
      we have developed a novel functional genomics methodology to express
      common locus haplotypes to assess functional differences. DNA
      recombination was used to engineer 5 bacterial artificial chromosomes
      (BACs) to each express a different haplotype of the NCSTN locus. Each
      NCSTN-BAC was delivered to knockout nicastrin (Ncstn(-/-)) cells and
      clonal NCSTN-BAC(+)/Ncstn(-/-) cell lines were created for functional
      analyses. We showed that all NCSTN-BAC haplotypes expressed nicastrin
      protein and rescued gamma-secretase activity and amyloid beta (Abeta)
      production in NCSTN-BAC(+)/Ncstn(-/-) lines. We then showed that genetic
      variation at the NCSTN locus affected alternative splicing in human
      postmortem brain tissue. However, there was no robust functional
      difference between clonal cell lines rescued by each of the 5 different
      haplotypes. Finally, there was no statistically significant association of
      NCSTN with disease risk in the 4 cohorts. We therefore conclude that it is
      unlikely that common variation at the NCSTN locus is a risk factor for
      Alzheimer's disease.

      Exome sequencing reveals an unexpected genetic cause of disease: NOTCH3
      mutation in a Turkish family with Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Neurobiol Aging
    volume: 33
    issue: 5
    pages: 1008 e17-23
    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically complex disorder for which the
      definite diagnosis is only accomplished postmortem. Mutations in 3 genes
      (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2) are known to cause AD, but a large number of
      familial cases do not harbor mutations in these genes and several
      unidentified genes that contain disease-causing mutations are thought to
      exist. We performed whole exome sequencing in a Turkish patient clinically
      diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease from a consanguineous family with a
      complex history of neurological and immunological disorders and identified
      a mutation in NOTCH3 (p.R1231C), previously described as causing cerebral
      autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
      leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Complete screening of NOTCH3 in a cohort of
      95 early onset AD cases and 95 controls did not reveal any additional
      pathogenic mutations. Although the complex history of disease in this
      family precluded us to establish segregation of the mutation found with
      disease, our results show that exome sequencing is a rapid, cost-effective
      and comprehensive tool to detect genetic mutations, allowing for the
      identification of unexpected genetic causes of clinical phenotypes. As
      etiological based therapeutics become more common, this method will be key
      in diagnosing and treating disease.

      Rare variants in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 increase risk for AD in late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease families
    journal: PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource]
    volume: 7
    issue: 2
    pages: e31039
    abstract: >-
      Pathogenic mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, MAPT and GRN have previously
      been linked to familial early onset forms of dementia. Mutation screening
      in these genes has been performed in either very small series or in single
      families with late onset AD (LOAD). Similarly, studies in single families
      have reported mutations in MAPT and GRN associated with clinical AD but no
      systematic screen of a large dataset has been performed to determine how
      frequently this occurs. We report sequence data for 439 probands from
      late-onset AD families with a history of four or more affected
      individuals. Sixty sequenced individuals (13.7%) carried a novel or
      pathogenic mutation. Eight pathogenic variants, (one each in APP and MAPT,
      two in PSEN1 and four in GRN) three of which are novel, were found in 14
      samples. Thirteen additional variants, present in 23 families, did not
      segregate with disease, but the frequency of these variants is higher in
      AD cases than controls, indicating that these variants may also modify
      risk for disease. The frequency of rare variants in these genes in this
      series is significantly higher than in the 1,000 genome project (p = 5.09
      × 10⁻⁵; OR = 2.21; 95%CI = 1.49-3.28) or an unselected population of
      12,481 samples (p = 6.82 × 10⁻⁵; OR = 2.19; 95%CI = 1.347-3.26). Rare
      coding variants in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, increase risk for or cause late
      onset AD. The presence of variants in these genes in LOAD and early-onset
      AD demonstrates that factors other than the mutation can impact the age at
      onset and penetrance of at least some variants associated with AD. MAPT
      and GRN mutations can be found in clinical series of AD most likely due to
      misdiagnosis. This study clearly demonstrates that rare variants in these
      genes could explain an important proportion of genetic heritability of AD,
      which is not detected by GWAS.

      Evaluating the role of the FUS/TLS-related gene EWSR1 in amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis
    journal: Hum Mol Genet
    volume: 21
    issue: 13
    pages: 2899-911
    abstract: >-
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease
      affecting motor neurons. Mutations in related RNA-binding proteins TDP-43,
      FUS/TLS and TAF15 have been connected to ALS. These three proteins share
      several features, including the presence of a bioinformatics-predicted
      prion domain, aggregation-prone nature in vitro and in vivo and toxic
      effects when expressed in multiple model systems. Given these
      commonalities, we hypothesized that a related protein, EWSR1 (Ewing
      sarcoma breakpoint region 1), might also exhibit similar properties and
      therefore could contribute to disease. Here, we report an analysis of
      EWSR1 in multiple functional assays, including mutational screening in ALS
      patients and controls. We identified three missense variants in EWSR1 in
      ALS patients, which were absent in a large number of healthy control
      individuals. We show that disease-specific variants affect EWSR1
      localization in motor neurons. We also provide multiple independent lines
      of in vitro and in vivo evidence that EWSR1 has similar properties as
      TDP-43, FUS and TAF15, including aggregation-prone behavior in vitro and
      ability to confer neurodegeneration in Drosophila. Postmortem analysis of
      sporadic ALS cases also revealed cytoplasmic mislocalization of EWSR1.
      Together, our studies highlight a potential role for EWSR1 in ALS, provide
      a collection of functional assays to be used to assess roles of additional
      RNA-binding proteins in disease and support an emerging concept that a
      class of aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins might contribute broadly
      to ALS and related neurodegenerative diseases.

      Evidence for a role of the rare p.A152T variant in MAPT in increasing the
      risk for FTD-spectrum and Alzheimer's diseases
    journal: Hum Mol Genet
    volume: 21
    issue: 15
    pages: 3500-12
    abstract: >-
      Rare mutations in the gene encoding for tau (MAPT, microtubule-associated
      protein tau) cause frontotemporal dementia-spectrum (FTD-s) disorders,
      including FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal
      syndrome, and a common extended haplotype spanning across the MAPT locus
      is associated with increased risk of PSP and Parkinson's disease. We
      identified a rare tau variant (p.A152T) in a patient with a clinical
      diagnosis of PSP and assessed its frequency in multiple independent series
      of patients with neurodegenerative conditions and controls, in a total of
      15 369 subjects. Tau p.A152T significantly increases the risk for both
      FTD-s (n = 2139, OR = 3.0, CI: 1.6-5.6, P = 0.0005) and Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) (n = 3345, OR = 2.3, CI: 1.3-4.2, P = 0.004) compared with
      9047 controls. Functionally, p.A152T (i) decreases the binding of tau to
      microtubules and therefore promotes microtubule assembly less efficiently;
      and (ii) reduces the tendency to form abnormal fibers. However, there is a
      pronounced increase in the formation of tau oligomers. Importantly, these
      findings suggest that other regions of the tau protein may be crucial in
      regulating normal function, as the p.A152 residue is distal to the domains
      considered responsible for microtubule interactions or aggregation. These
      data provide both the first genetic evidence and functional studies
      supporting the role of MAPT p.A152T as a rare risk factor for both FTD-s
      and AD and the concept that rare variants can increase the risk for
      relatively common, complex neurodegenerative diseases, but since no clear
      significance threshold for rare genetic variation has been established,
      some caution is warranted until the findings are further replicated.

      OBJECTIVE: Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have associated
      variants in late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) susceptibility genes;
      however, these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have very modest
      effects, suggesting that single SNP approaches may be inadequate to
      identify genetic risks. An alternative approach is the use of multilocus
      genotype patterns (MLGPs) that combine SNPs at different susceptibility
      genes. METHODS: Using data from 1,365 subjects in the National Institute
      on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study, we conducted a
      family-based association study in which we tabulated MLGPs for SNPs at
      CR1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, and APOE. We used generalized estimating equations
      to model episodic memory as the dependent endophenotype of LOAD and the
      MLGPs as predictors while adjusting for sex, age, and education. RESULTS:
      Several genotype patterns influenced episodic memory performance. A
      pattern that included PICALM and CLU was the strongest genotypic profile
      for lower memory performance (beta = -0.32, SE = 0.19, p = 0.021). The
      effect was stronger after addition of APOE (p = 0.016). Two additional
      patterns involving PICALM, CR1, and APOE and another pattern involving
      PICALM, BIN1, and APOE were also associated with significantly poorer
      memory performance (beta = -0.44, SE = 0.09, p = 0.009 and beta = -0.29,
      SE = 0.07, p = 0.012) even after exclusion of patients with LOAD. We also
      identified genotype pattern involving variants in PICALM, CLU, and APOE as
      a predictor of better memory performance (beta = 0.26, SE = 0.10, p =
      0.010). CONCLUSIONS: MLGPs provide an alternative analytical approach to
      predict an individual's genetic risk for episodic memory performance, a
      surrogate indicator of LOAD. Identifying genotypic patterns contributing
      to the decline of an individual's cognitive performance may be a critical
      step along the road to preclinical detection of Alzheimer disease.

      Glutathione S-transferase omega genes in Alzheimer and Parkinson disease
      risk, age-at-diagnosis and brain gene expression: an association study
      with mechanistic implications
    journal: Mol Neurodegener
    volume: 7
    issue: ""
    pages: 13
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferase omega-1 and 2 genes (GSTO1, GSTO2),
      residing within an Alzheimer and Parkinson disease (AD and PD) linkage
      region, have diverse functions including mitigation of oxidative stress
      and may underlie the pathophysiology of both diseases. GSTO polymorphisms
      were previously reported to associate with risk and age-at-onset of these
      diseases, although inconsistent follow-up study designs make
      interpretation of results difficult. We assessed two previously reported
      SNPs, GSTO1 rs4925 and GSTO2 rs156697, in AD (3,493 ADs vs. 4,617
      controls) and PD (678 PDs vs. 712 controls) for association with disease
      risk (case-controls), age-at-diagnosis (cases) and brain gene expression
      levels (autopsied subjects). RESULTS: We found that rs156697 minor allele
      associates with significantly increased risk (odds ratio = 1.14, p =
      0.038) in the older ADs with age-at-diagnosis &#62; 80 years. The minor
      allele of GSTO1 rs4925 associates with decreased risk in familial PD (odds
      ratio = 0.78, p = 0.034). There was no other association with disease risk
      or age-at-diagnosis. The minor alleles of both GSTO SNPs associate with
      lower brain levels of GSTO2 (p = 4.7 x 10-11-1.9 x 10-27), but not GSTO1.
      Pathway analysis of significant genes in our brain expression GWAS,
      identified significant enrichment for glutathione metabolism genes (p =
      0.003). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that GSTO locus variants may
      lower brain GSTO2 levels and consequently confer AD risk in older age.
      Other glutathione metabolism genes should be assessed for their effects on
      AD and other chronic, neurologic diseases.

      Novel late-onset Alzheimer disease loci variants associate with brain gene
      expression
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 79
    issue: 3
    pages: 221-8
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset
      Alzheimer disease (LOAD) identified 9 novel risk loci. Discovery of
      functional variants within genes at these loci is required to confirm
      their role in Alzheimer disease (AD). Single nucleotide polymorphisms that
      influence gene expression (eSNPs) constitute an important class of
      functional variants. We therefore investigated the influence of the novel
      LOAD risk loci on human brain gene expression. METHODS: We measured gene
      expression levels in the cerebellum and temporal cortex of autopsied AD
      subjects and those with other brain pathologies ( approximately 400 total
      subjects). To determine whether any of the novel LOAD risk variants are
      eSNPs, we tested their cis-association with expression of 6 nearby LOAD
      candidate genes detectable in human brain (ABCA7, BIN1, CLU, MS4A4A,
      MS4A6A, PICALM) and an additional 13 genes +/-100 kb of these SNPs. To
      identify additional eSNPs that influence brain gene expression levels of
      the novel candidate LOAD genes, we identified SNPs +/-100 kb of their
      location and tested for cis-associations. RESULTS: CLU rs11136000 (p =
      7.81 x 10(-4)) and MS4A4A rs2304933/rs2304935 (p = 1.48 x 10(-4)-1.86 x
      10(-4)) significantly influence temporal cortex expression levels of these
      genes. The LOAD-protective CLU and risky MS4A4A locus alleles associate
      with higher brain levels of these genes. There are other cis-variants that
      significantly influence brain expression of CLU and ABCA7 (p = 4.01 x
      10(-5)-9.09 x 10(-9)), some of which also associate with AD risk (p = 2.64
      x 10(-2)-6.25 x 10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: CLU and MS4A4A eSNPs may at least
      partly explain the LOAD risk association at these loci. CLU and ABCA7 may
      harbor additional strong eSNPs. These results have implications in the
      search for functional variants at the novel LOAD risk loci.

      Heritability of different forms of memory in the Late Onset Alzheimer's
      Disease Family Study
    journal: J Alzheimers Dis
    volume: 23
    issue: 2
    pages: 249-55
    abstract: >-
      The study aim was to estimate the genetic contribution to individual
      differences in different forms of memory in a large family-based group of
      older adults. As part of the Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study,
      899 persons (277 with Alzheimer's disease, 622 unaffected) from 325
      families completed a battery of memory tests from which previously
      established composite measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, and
      working memory were derived. Heritability in these measures was estimated
      using the maximum likelihood variance component method, controlling for
      age, gender, and education. In analyses of unaffected family members, the
      adjusted heritability estimates were 0.62 for episodic memory, 0.49 for
      semantic memory, and 0.72 for working memory, where a heritability
      estimate of 1 indicates that genetic factors explain all of the phenotypic
      variance and a heritability of 0 indicates that genetic factors explain
      none. Adjustment for APOE genotype had little effect on these estimates.
      When analyses included affected and unaffected family members, adjusted
      heritability estimates were lower (0.47 for episodic memory, 0.32 for
      semantic memory, 0.42 for working memory). Adjusting for APOE slightly
      reduced the estimate for episodic memory (0.40) but had no effect on the
      remaining estimates. The results indicate that memory functions are under
      strong genetic influence in older persons with and without AD, and are
      only partly attributable to APOE. This suggests that genetic analyses of
      memory endophenotypes may help to identify genetic variants associated
      with AD.

      Genome-wide association of familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease
      replicates BIN1 and CLU and nominates CUGBP2 in interaction with APOE
    journal: PLoS Genet
    volume: 7
    issue: 2

    abstract: >-
      Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common form of dementia
      in the elderly. The National Institute of Aging-Late Onset Alzheimer's
      Disease Family Study and the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's
      Disease conducted a joint genome-wide association study (GWAS) of
      multiplex LOAD families (3,839 affected and unaffected individuals from
      992 families plus additional unrelated neurologically evaluated normal
      subjects) using the 610 IlluminaQuad panel. This cohort represents the
      largest family-based GWAS of LOAD to date, with analyses limited here to
      the European-American subjects. SNPs near APOE gave highly significant
      results (e.g., rs2075650, p = 3.2x10(-81)), but no other genome-wide
      significant evidence for association was obtained in the full sample.
      Analyses that stratified on APOE genotypes identified SNPs on chromosome
      10p14 in CUGBP2 with genome-wide significant evidence for association
      within APOE epsilon4 homozygotes (e.g., rs201119, p = 1.5x10(-8)).
      Association in this gene was replicated in an independent sample
      consisting of three cohorts. There was evidence of association for
      recently-reported LOAD risk loci, including BIN1 (rs7561528, p = 0.009
      with, and p = 0.03 without, APOE adjustment) and CLU (rs11136000, p =
      0.023 with, and p = 0.008 without, APOE adjustment), with weaker support
      for CR1. However, our results provide strong evidence that association
      with PICALM (rs3851179, p = 0.69 with, and p = 0.039 without, APOE
      adjustment) and EXOC3L2 is affected by correlation with APOE, and thus may
      represent spurious association. Our results indicate that genetic
      structure coupled with ascertainment bias resulting from the strong APOE
      association affect genome-wide results and interpretation of some recently
      reported associations. We show that a locus such as APOE, with large
      effects and strong association with disease, can lead to samples that
      require appropriate adjustment for this locus to avoid both false positive
      and false negative evidence of association. We suggest that similar
      adjustments may also be needed for many other large multi-site studies.

      Copy number variants (CNVs) are DNA sequence alterations, resulting in
      gains (duplications) and losses (deletions) of genomic segments. They
      often overlap genes and may play important roles in disease. Only one
      published study has examined CNVs in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      and none have examined mild cognitive impairment (MCI). CNV calls were
      generated in 288 AD, 183 MCI, and 184 healthy control (HC) non-Hispanic
      Caucasian Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants. After
      quality control, 222 AD, 136 MCI, and 143 HC participants were entered
      into case/control association analyses, including candidate gene and whole
      genome approaches. Although no excess CNV burden was observed in cases (AD
      and/or MCI) relative to controls (HC), gene-based analyses revealed CNVs
      overlapping the candidate gene CHRFAM7A, as well as CSMD1, SLC35F2,
      HNRNPCL1, NRXN1, and ERBB4 regions, only in cases. Replication in larger
      samples is important, after which regions detected here may be promising
      targets for resequencing.

      False positives in neuroimaging genetics using voxel-based morphometry
      data
    journal: Neuroimage
    volume: 54
    issue: 2
    pages: 992-1000
    abstract: >-
      Voxel-wise statistical inference is commonly used to identify significant
      experimental effects or group differences in both functional and
      structural studies of the living brain. Tests based on the size of
      spatially extended clusters of contiguous suprathreshold voxels are also
      widely used due to their typically increased statistical power. In
      &#34;imaging genetics&#34;, such tests are used to identify regions of the
      brain that are associated with genetic variation. However, concerns have
      been raised about the adequate control of rejection rates in studies of
      this type. A previous study tested the effect of a set of 'null' SNPs on
      brain structure and function, and found that false positive rates were
      well-controlled. However, no similar analysis of false positive rates in
      an imaging genetic study using cluster size inference has yet been
      undertaken. We measured false positive rates in an investigation of the
      effect of 700 pre-selected null SNPs on grey matter volume using
      voxel-based morphometry (VBM). As VBM data exhibit spatially-varying
      smoothness, we used both non-stationary and stationary cluster size tests
      in our analysis. Image and genotype data on 181 subjects with mild
      cognitive impairment were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). At a nominal significance level of 5%,
      false positive rates were found to be well-controlled (3.9-5.6%), using a
      relatively high cluster-forming threshold, alpha(c)=0.001, on images
      smoothed with a 12 mm Gaussian kernel. Tests were however anticonservative
      at lower cluster-forming thresholds (alpha(c)=0.01, 0.05), and for images
      smoothed using a 6mm Gaussian kernel. Here false positive rates ranged
      from 9.8 to 67.6%. In a further analysis, false positive rates using
      simulated data were observed to be well-controlled across a wide range of
      conditions. While motivated by imaging genetics, our findings apply to any
      VBM study, and suggest that parametric cluster size inference should only
      be used with high cluster-forming thresholds and smoothness. We would
      advocate the use of nonparametric methods in other cases.

      The role of clusterin, complement receptor 1, and phosphatidylinositol
      binding clathrin assembly protein in Alzheimer disease risk and
      cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels
    journal: Arch Gen Psychiatry
    volume: 68
    issue: 2
    pages: 207-13
    abstract: >-
      CONTEXT: Two recent and simultaneously published genome-wide association
      studies independently implicated clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1
      (CR1), and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM)
      as putative novel Alzheimer disease (AD) risk loci. Despite their strong
      statistical support, all 3 signals emerged from heterogeneous case-control
      populations and lack replication in different settings. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine whether genetic variants in CLU, CR1, and PICALM confer risk for
      AD in independent data sets (n = 4254) and to test the impact of these
      markers on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-Abeta42 and total-tau protein levels
      (n = 425). DESIGN: Genetic association study using family-based and
      case-control designs. SETTING: Ambulatory or hospitalized care.
      PARTICIPANTS: Family samples originate from mostly multiplex pedigrees
      recruited at different centers in the United States (1245 families, 2654
      individuals with AD, and 1175 unaffected relatives). Unrelated
      case-control subjects originate from 1 clinical center in Germany (214
      individuals with AD and 211 controls). All subjects were of European
      descent. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The association between 5 genetic variants
      in CLU, CR1, and PICALM and risk for AD, and the correlation between these
      5 genetic variants and CSF-Abeta42 and tau levels. RESULTS: All 3
      investigated loci showed significant associations between risk for AD
      (1-tailed P values ranging from &#60;.001 to .02) and consistent effect
      sizes and direction. For each locus, the overall evidence of association
      was substantially strengthened on meta-analysis of all available data
      (2-tailed P values ranging from 1.1 x 10(-16) to 4.1 x 10(-)(7)). Of all
      markers tested, only rs541458 in PICALM was shown to have an effect on CSF
      protein levels, suggesting that the AD risk allele is associated with
      decreased CSF Abeta42 levels (2-tailed P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      provides compelling independent evidence that genetic variants in CLU,
      CR1, and PICALM are genetically associated with risk for AD. Furthermore,
      the CSF biomarker analyses provide a first insight into the potentially
      predominant pathogenetic mechanism(s) underlying the association between
      AD risk and PICALM.

      A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the cause of chromosome
      9p21-linked ALS-FTD
    journal: Neuron
    volume: 72
    issue: 2
    pages: 257-68
    abstract: >-
      The chromosome 9p21 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia
      (ALS-FTD) locus contains one of the last major unidentified
      autosomal-dominant genes underlying these common neurodegenerative
      diseases. We have previously shown that a founder haplotype, covering the
      MOBKL2b, IFNK, and C9ORF72 genes, is present in the majority of cases
      linked to this region. Here we show that there is a large hexanucleotide
      (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of C9ORF72 on the affected
      haplotype. This repeat expansion segregates perfectly with disease in the
      Finnish population, underlying 46.0% of familial ALS and 21.1% of sporadic
      ALS in that population. Taken together with the D90A SOD1 mutation, 87% of
      familial ALS in Finland is now explained by a simple monogenic cause. The
      repeat expansion is also present in one-third of familial ALS cases of
      outbred European descent, making it the most common genetic cause of these
      fatal neurodegenerative diseases identified to date.

      SORCS1 alters amyloid precursor protein processing and variants may
      increase Alzheimer's disease risk
    journal: Ann Neurol
    volume: 69
    issue: 1
    pages: 47-64
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: Sorting mechanisms that cause the amyloid precursor protein
      (APP) and the beta-secretases and gamma-secretases to colocalize in the
      same compartment play an important role in the regulation of Abeta
      production in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We and others have reported that
      genetic variants in the Sortilin-related receptor (SORL1) increased the
      risk of AD, that SORL1 is involved in trafficking of APP, and that
      underexpression of SORL1 leads to overproduction of Abeta. Here we
      explored the role of one of its homologs, the sortilin-related VPS10
      domain containing receptor 1 (SORCS1), in AD. METHODS: We analyzed the
      genetic associations between AD and 16 SORCS1-single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in 6 independent data sets (2,809 cases and 3,482
      controls). In addition, we compared SorCS1 expression levels of affected
      and unaffected brain regions in AD and control brains in microarray gene
      expression and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) sets, explored
      the effects of significant SORCS1-SNPs on SorCS1 brain expression levels,
      and explored the effect of suppression and overexpression of the common
      SorCS1 isoforms on APP processing and Abeta generation. RESULTS: Inherited
      variants in SORCS1 were associated with AD in all datasets (0.001 &#60; p
      &#60; 0.049). In addition, SorCS1 influenced APP processing. While
      overexpression of SorCS1 reduced gamma-secretase activity and Abeta
      levels, the suppression of SorCS1 increased gamma-secretase processing of
      APP and the levels of Abeta. INTERPRETATIONS: These data suggest that
      inherited or acquired changes in SORCS1 expression or function may play a
      role in the pathogenesis of AD.

    title: Impact of genetic variation in SORCS1 on memory retention
    journal: PLoS One
    volume: 6
    issue: 10
    pages: e24588
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: We previously reported that genetic variants in SORCS1 increase
      the risk of AD, that over-expression of SorCS1 reduces gamma-secretase
      activity and Abeta levels, and that SorCS1 suppression increases
      gamma-secretase processing of APP and Abeta levels. We now explored the
      effect of variation in SORCS1 on memory. METHODS: We explored associations
      between SORCS1-SNPs and memory retention in the NIA-AD FBS case control
      dataset (162 cases,670 controls) and a cohort of Caribbean Hispanics (549
      cases,544 controls) using single marker and haplotype analyses. RESULTS:
      Three SNPs in intron 1, were associated with memory retention in the
      NIA-AD FBS dataset or the Caribbean Hispanic dataset (rs10884402(A
      allele:beta = -0.15,p = 0.008), rs7078098(C allele:beta = 0.18,p = 0.007)
      and rs950809(C allele:beta = 0.17,p = 0.008)) and all three SNPs were
      significant in a meta-analysis of both datasets (0.002&#60;p&#60;0.03).
      The corresponding A-T-T haplotype for these SNPs was associated with lower
      scores in both datasets (p = 0.02,p = 0.0009), and the complementary G-C-C
      haplotype was associated with higher scores in NIA-AD FBS (p = 0.02).
      These associations were restricted to cases. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in
      intron 1 in SORCS1 is associated with memory changes in AD.

      Meta-analysis of the Association Between Variants in SORL1 and Alzheimer
      Disease
    journal: Archives of Neurology
    volume: 68
    issue: 1
    pages: 99-106
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: To reexamine the association between the neuronal
      sortilin-related receptor gene (SORL1) and Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN:
      Comprehensive and unbiased meta-analysis of all published and unpublished
      data from case-control studies for the SORL1 single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) that had been repeatedly assessed across studies.
      SETTING: Academic research institutions in the United States, the
      Netherlands, Canada, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Japan,
      Sweden, Germany, France, and Italy. PARTICIPANTS: All published white and
      Asian case-control data sets, which included a total of 12 464 cases and
      17 929 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Alzheimer disease according to the
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) and
      the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
      Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (now
      known as the Alzheimer’s Association). RESULTS: In the white data sets,
      several markers were associated with AD after correction for multiple
      testing, including previously reported SNPs 8, 9, and 10 (P&#60;.001). In
      addition, the C-G-C haplotype at SNPs 8 through 10 was associated with AD
      risk (P&#60;.001). In the combined Asian data sets, SNPs 19 and 23 through
      25 were associated with AD risk (P&#60;.001). The disease-associated
      alleles at SNPs 8, 9, and 10 (120 873 131-120 886 175 base pairs [bp];
      C-G-C alleles), at SNP 19 (120 953 300 bp; G allele), and at SNPs 24
      through 25 (120 988 611 bp; T and C alleles) were the same previously
      reported alleles. The SNPs 4 through 5, 8 through 10, 12, and 19 through
      25 belong to distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks. The same alleles at
      SNPs 8 through 10 (C-G-C), 19 (G), and 24 and 25 (T and C) have also been
      associated with AD endophenotypes, including white matter hyperintensities
      and hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid
      measures of amyloid β-peptide 42, and full-length SORL1 expression in the
      human brain. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis provides
      confirmatory evidence that multiple SORL1 variants in distinct linkage
      disequilibrium blocks are associated with AD.

      Mutations in the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene cause
      hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids
    journal: Nat Genet
    volume: 44
    issue: 2
    pages: 200-5
    abstract: >-
      Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) is an
      autosomal-dominant central nervous system white-matter disease with
      variable clinical presentations, including personality and behavioral
      changes, dementia, depression, parkinsonism, seizures and other
      phenotypes. We combined genome-wide linkage analysis with exome sequencing
      and identified 14 different mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domain
      of the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (encoded by CSF1R) in 14
      families with HDLS. In one kindred, we confirmed the de novo occurrence of
      the mutation. Follow-up sequencing identified an additional CSF1R mutation
      in an individual diagnosed with corticobasal syndrome. In vitro, CSF-1
      stimulation resulted in rapid autophosphorylation of selected tyrosine
      residues in the kinase domain of wild-type but not mutant CSF1R,
      suggesting that HDLS may result from partial loss of CSF1R function. As
      CSF1R is a crucial mediator of microglial proliferation and
      differentiation in the brain, our findings suggest an important role for
      microglial dysfunction in HDLS pathogenesis.

      Distinctive genetic and clinical features of CMT4J: a severe neuropathy
      caused by mutations in the PI(3,5)P(2) phosphatase FIG4
    journal: Brain
    volume: 134
    issue: Pt 7
    pages: 1959-71
    abstract: >-
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a genetically heterogeneous group of motor
      and sensory neuropathies associated with mutations in more than 30 genes.
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J (OMIM 611228) is a recessive,
      potentially severe form of the disease caused by mutations of the lipid
      phosphatase FIG4. We provide a more complete view of the features of this
      disorder by describing 11 previously unreported patients with
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J. Three patients were identified from a
      small cohort selected for screening because of their early onset disease
      and progressive proximal as well as distal weakness. Eight patients were
      identified by large-scale exon sequencing of an unselected group of 4000
      patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In addition, 34 new FIG4
      variants were detected. Ten of the new CMT4J cases have the compound
      heterozygous genotype FIG4(I41T/null) described in the original four
      families, while one has the novel genotype FIG4(L17P/nul)(l). The
      population frequency of the I41T allele was found to be 0.001 by
      genotyping 5769 Northern European controls. Thirty four new variants of
      FIG4 were identified. The severity of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J
      ranges from mild clinical signs to severe disability requiring the use of
      a wheelchair. Both mild and severe forms have been seen in patients with
      the same genotype. The results demonstrate that Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      disease type 4J is characterized by highly variable onset and severity,
      proximal as well as distal and asymmetric muscle weakness,
      electromyography demonstrating denervation in proximal and distal muscles,
      and frequent progression to severe amyotrophy. FIG4 mutations should be
      considered in Charcot-Marie-Tooth patients with these characteristics,
      especially if found in combination with sporadic or recessive inheritance,
      childhood onset and a phase of rapid progression.

    title: The effect of reference panels and software tools on genotype imputation
    journal: AMIA Annu Symp Proc
    volume: 2011
    issue: ""
    pages: 1013-8
    abstract: >-
      Genotype imputation is increasingly employed in genome-wide association
      studies, particularly for integrative and cross-platform analysis. Several
      imputation algorithms use reference panels with a larger set of genotyped
      markers to infer genotypes at ungenotyped marker locations. Our objective
      was to assess which method and reference panel was more accurate when
      carrying out imputation. We investigated the influence of choice of two
      most popular imputation methods, IMPUTE and MACH, on two reference panels
      from the HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project. Our results indicated that
      for the HapMap, MACH consistently yielded more accurate imputation results
      than IMPUTE, while for the 1000 Genomes Project, IMPUTE performed slightly
      better. The best imputation results were achieved by IMPUTE with the
      combined reference panel (HapMap + 1000 Genomes Project). IMPUTE with the
      combined reference panel is a promising strategy for genotype imputation,
      which should facilitate fine-mapping for discovery as well as known
      disease-associated candidate regions.

    abstract: >-
      The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) performed a genome-wide
      association study of late-onset Alzheimer disease using a three-stage
      design consisting of a discovery stage (stage 1) and two replication
      stages (stages 2 and 3). Both joint analysis and meta-analysis approaches
      were used. We obtained genome-wide significant results at MS4A4A
      (rs4938933; stages 1 and 2, meta-analysis P (P(M)) = 1.7 x 10(-9), joint
      analysis P (P(J)) = 1.7 x 10(-9); stages 1, 2 and 3, P(M) = 8.2 x
      10(-12)), CD2AP (rs9349407; stages 1, 2 and 3, P(M) = 8.6 x 10(-9)), EPHA1
      (rs11767557; stages 1, 2 and 3, P(M) = 6.0 x 10(-10)) and CD33 (rs3865444;
      stages 1, 2 and 3, P(M) = 1.6 x 10(-9)). We also replicated previous
      associations at CR1 (rs6701713; P(M) = 4.6 x 10(-10), P(J) = 5.2 x
      10(-11)), CLU (rs1532278; P(M) = 8.3 x 10(-8), P(J) = 1.9 x 10(-8)), BIN1
      (rs7561528; P(M) = 4.0 x 10(-14), P(J) = 5.2 x 10(-14)) and PICALM
      (rs561655; P(M) = 7.0 x 10(-11), P(J) = 1.0 x 10(-10)), but not at
      EXOC3L2, to late-onset Alzheimer's disease susceptibility.

      OBJECTIVES: To identify novel loci for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD)
      in Caribbean Hispanic individuals and to replicate the findings in a
      publicly available data set from the National Institute on Aging
      Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study. DESIGN: Nested case-control
      genome-wide association study. SETTING: The Washington Heights-Inwood
      Columbia Aging Project and the Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica de
      Alzheimer study. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred forty-nine affected and 544
      unaffected individuals of Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. INTERVENTION: The
      Illumina HumanHap 650Y chip for genotyping. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical
      diagnosis or pathologically confirmed diagnosis of LOAD. RESULTS: The
      strongest support for allelic association was for rs9945493 on 18q23
      (P=1.7x10(-7)), but 22 additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      had a P value less than 9x10(-6) under 3 different analyses: unadjusted
      and stratified by the presence or absence of the APOE epsilon4 allele. Of
      these SNPs, 5 SNPs (rs4669573 and rs10197851 on 2p25.1; rs11711889 on
      3q25.2; rs1117750 on 7p21.1; and rs7908652 on 10q23.1) were associated
      with LOAD in an independent cohort from the National Institute on Aging
      Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study. We also replicated genetic
      associations for CLU, PICALM, and BIN1. CONCLUSIONS: Our genome-wide
      search of Caribbean Hispanic individuals identified several novel genetic
      variants associated with LOAD and replicated these associations in a white
      cohort. We also replicated associations in CLU, PICALM, and BIN1 in the
      Caribbean Hispanic cohort.

      Genome-wide association study of CSF biomarkers Abeta1-42, t-tau, and
      p-tau181p in the ADNI cohort
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 76
    issue: 1
    pages: 69-79
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVES: CSF levels of Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p are potential
      early diagnostic markers for probable Alzheimer disease (AD). The
      influence of genetic variation on these markers has been investigated for
      candidate genes but not on a genome-wide basis. We report a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) of CSF biomarkers (Abeta1-42, t-tau, p-tau181p,
      p-tau181p/Abeta1-42, and t-tau/Abeta1-42). METHODS: A total of 374
      non-Hispanic Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative cohort with quality-controlled CSF and genotype
      data were included in this analysis. The main effect of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) under an additive genetic model was assessed on each
      of 5 CSF biomarkers. The p values of all SNPs for each CSF biomarker were
      adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. We focused on
      SNPs with corrected p&#60;0.01 (uncorrected p&#60;3.10x10(-8)) and
      secondarily examined SNPs with uncorrected p values less than 10(-5) to
      identify potential candidates. RESULTS: Four SNPs in the regions of the
      APOE, LOC100129500, TOMM40, and EPC2 genes reached genome-wide
      significance for associations with one or more CSF biomarkers. SNPs in
      CCDC134, ABCG2, SREBF2, and NFATC4, although not reaching genome-wide
      significance, were identified as potential candidates. CONCLUSIONS: In
      addition to known candidate genes, APOE, TOMM40, and one hypothetical gene
      LOC100129500 partially overlapping APOE; one novel gene, EPC2, and several
      other interesting genes were associated with CSF biomarkers that are
      related to AD. These findings, especially the new EPC2 results, require
      replication in independent cohorts.

      Common variants at ABCA7, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, EPHA1, CD33 and CD2AP are

    abstract: >-
      We sought to identify new susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease
      through a staged association study (GERAD+) and by testing suggestive loci
      reported by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC) in a
      companion paper. We undertook a combined analysis of four genome-wide
      association datasets (stage 1) and identified ten newly associated
      variants with P &#60;/= 1 x 10(-5). We tested these variants for
      association in an independent sample (stage 2). Three SNPs at two loci
      replicated and showed evidence for association in a further sample (stage
      3). Meta-analyses of all data provided compelling evidence that ABCA7
      (rs3764650, meta P = 4.5 x 10(-17); including ADGC data, meta P = 5.0 x
      10(-21)) and the MS4A gene cluster (rs610932, meta P = 1.8 x 10(-14);
      including ADGC data, meta P = 1.2 x 10(-16)) are new Alzheimer's disease
      susceptibility loci. We also found independent evidence for association
      for three loci reported by the ADGC, which, when combined, showed
      genome-wide significance: CD2AP (GERAD+, P = 8.0 x 10(-4); including ADGC
      data, meta P = 8.6 x 10(-9)), CD33 (GERAD+, P = 2.2 x 10(-4); including
      ADGC data, meta P = 1.6 x 10(-9)) and EPHA1 (GERAD+, P = 3.4 x 10(-4);
      including ADGC data, meta P = 6.0 x 10(-10)).

      Voxelwise gene-wide association study (vGeneWAS): multivariate gene-based
      association testing in 731 elderly subjects
    journal: Neuroimage
    volume: 56
    issue: 4
    pages: 1875-91
    abstract: >-
      Imaging traits provide a powerful and biologically relevant substrate to
      examine the influence of genetics on the brain. Interest in genome-wide,
      brain-wide search for influential genetic variants is growing, but has
      mainly focused on univariate, SNP-based association tests. Moving to
      gene-based multivariate statistics, we can test the combined effect of
      multiple genetic variants in a single test statistic. Multivariate models
      can reduce the number of statistical tests in gene-wide or genome-wide
      scans and may discover gene effects undetectable with SNP-based methods.
      Here we present a gene-based method for associating the joint effect of
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18,044 genes across 31,662
      voxels of the whole brain in 731 elderly subjects (mean age:
      75.56+/-6.82SD years; 430 males) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI). Structural MRI scans were analyzed using tensor-based
      morphometry (TBM) to compute 3D maps of regional brain volume differences
      compared to an average template image based on healthy elderly subjects.
      Using the voxel-level volume difference values as the phenotype, we
      selected the most significantly associated gene (out of 18,044) at each
      voxel across the brain. No genes identified were significant after
      correction for multiple comparisons, but several known candidates were
      re-identified, as were other genes highly relevant to brain function.
      GAB2, which has been previously associated with late-onset AD, was
      identified as the top gene in this study, suggesting the validity of the
      approach. This multivariate, gene-based voxelwise association study offers
      a novel framework to detect genetic influences on the brain.

      Association and expression analyses with single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      in TOMM40 in Alzheimer disease
    journal: Arch Neurol
    volume: 68
    issue: 8
    pages: 1013-9
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the most statistically significant
      genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). The linkage
      disequilibrium pattern around the APOE gene has made it difficult to
      determine whether all the association signal is derived from APOE or
      whether there is an independent signal from a nearby gene. OBJECTIVE: To
      attempt to replicate a recently reported association of APOE 3-TOMM40
      haplotypes with risk and age at onset. DESIGN: We used standard techniques
      to genotype several polymorphisms in the APOE-TOMM40 region in a large
      case-control series, in a series with cerebrospinal fluid biomarker data,
      and in brain tissue. SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.
      PARTICIPANTS: Research volunteers who were cognitively normal or had
      Alzheimer disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease status and age at onset.
      RESULTS: We did not replicate the previously reported association of the
      polyT polymorphism (rs10524523) with risk and age at onset. We found a
      significant association between rs10524523 and risk of LOAD in APOE 33
      homozygotes but in the opposite direction as the previously reported
      association (the very long allele was underrepresented in cases vs
      controls in this study (P = .004]). We found no association between
      rs10524523 and cerebrospinal fluid tau or beta-amyloid 42 levels or TOMM40
      or APOE gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Although we did not replicate the
      earlier association between the APOE 3-TOMM40 haplotypes and age at onset,
      we observed that the polyT polymorphism is associated with risk of LOAD in
      APOE 33 homozygotes in a large case-control series but in the opposite
      direction as in the previous study.

    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: To test whether rs1990622 (TMEM106B) is associated with age at
      onset (AAO) in granulin (GRN) mutation carriers and with plasma GRN levels
      in mutation carriers and healthy, elderly individuals. Rs1990622
      (TMEM106B) was identified as a risk factor for frontotemporal lobar
      degeneration with TAR DNA-binding protein inclusions (FTLD-TDP) in a
      recent genome-wide association. DESIGN: Rs1990622 was genotyped in GRN
      mutation carriers and tested for association with AAO using the
      Kaplan-Meier method and a Cox proportional hazards model. SETTING:
      Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Subjects We analyzed 50 affected and
      unaffected GRN mutation carriers from 4 previously reported FTLD-TDP
      families (HDDD1, FD1, HDDD2, and the Karolinska family). The GRN plasma
      levels were also measured in 73 healthy, elderly individuals. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Age at onset and GRN plasma levels. RESULTS: The risk allele of
      rs1990622 was associated with a mean decrease of the AAO of 13 years (P =
      9.9 x 10(-7)) and with lower plasma GRN levels in both healthy older
      adults (P = 4 x 10(-4)) and GRN mutation carriers (P = .0027). Analysis of
      the HapMap database identified a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide
      polymorphism rs3173615 (T185S) in perfect linkage disequilibrium with
      rs1990622. CONCLUSIONS: The association of rs1990622 with AAO explains, in
      part, the wide range in the AAO of disease among GRN mutation carriers. We
      hypothesize that rs1990622 or another variant in linkage disequilibrium
      could act in a manner similar to APOE in Alzheimer disease, increasing
      risk for disease in the general population and modifying AAO in mutation
      carriers. Our results also suggest that genetic variation in TMEM106B may
      influence risk for FTLD-TDP by modulating secreted levels of GRN.

    title: A yeast functional screen predicts new candidate ALS disease genes
    journal: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
    volume: 108
    issue: 52
    pages: 20881-90
    abstract: >-
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and universally fatal
      neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in two related RNA-binding proteins,
      TDP-43 and FUS, that harbor prion-like domains, cause some forms of ALS.
      There are at least 213 human proteins harboring RNA recognition motifs,
      including FUS and TDP-43, raising the possibility that additional
      RNA-binding proteins might contribute to ALS pathogenesis. We performed a
      systematic survey of these proteins to find additional candidates similar
      to TDP-43 and FUS, followed by bioinformatics to predict prion-like
      domains in a subset of them. We sequenced one of these genes, TAF15, in
      patients with ALS and identified missense variants, which were absent in a
      large number of healthy controls. These disease-associated variants of
      TAF15 caused formation of cytoplasmic foci when expressed in primary
      cultures of spinal cord neurons. Very similar to TDP-43 and FUS, TAF15
      aggregated in vitro and conferred neurodegeneration in Drosophila, with
      the ALS-linked variants having a more severe effect than wild type.
      Immunohistochemistry of postmortem spinal cord tissue revealed
      mislocalization of TAF15 in motor neurons of patients with ALS. We propose
      that aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins might contribute very broadly
      to ALS pathogenesis and the genes identified in our yeast functional
      screen, coupled with prion-like domain prediction analysis, now provide a
      powerful resource to facilitate ALS disease gene discovery.

      Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (vorinostat) up-regulates progranulin
      transcription: rational therapeutic approach to frontotemporal dementia
    journal: J Biol Chem

    abstract: >-
      Progranulin (GRN) haploinsufficiency is a frequent cause of familial
      frontotemporal dementia, a currently untreatable progressive
      neurodegenerative disease. By chemical library screening, we identified
      suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a Food and Drug
      Administration-approved histone deacetylase inhibitor, as an enhancer of
      GRN expression. SAHA dose-dependently increased GRN mRNA and protein
      levels in cultured cells and restored near-normal GRN expression in
      haploinsufficient cells from human subjects. Although elevation of
      secreted progranulin levels through a post-transcriptional mechanism has
      recently been reported, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
      report of a small molecule enhancer of progranulin transcription. SAHA has
      demonstrated therapeutic potential in other neurodegenerative diseases and
      thus holds promise as a first generation drug for the prevention and
      treatment of frontotemporal dementia.

      Human apoE isoforms differentially regulate brain amyloid-beta peptide
      clearance
    journal: Sci Transl Med
    volume: 3
    issue: 89
    pages: 89ra57
    abstract: >-
      The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is the strongest genetic risk
      factor for late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APOE
      epsilon4 allele markedly increases AD risk and decreases age of onset,
      likely through its strong effect on the accumulation of amyloid-beta
      (Abeta) peptide. In contrast, the APOE epsilon2 allele appears to decrease
      AD risk. Most rare, early-onset forms of familial AD are caused by
      autosomal dominant mutations that often lead to overproduction of
      Abeta(42) peptide. However, the mechanism by which APOE alleles
      differentially modulate Abeta accumulation in sporadic, late-onset AD is
      less clear. In a cohort of cognitively normal individuals, we report that
      reliable molecular and neuroimaging biomarkers of cerebral Abeta
      deposition vary in an apoE isoform-dependent manner. We hypothesized that
      human apoE isoforms differentially affect Abeta clearance or synthesis in
      vivo, resulting in an apoE isoform-dependent pattern of Abeta accumulation
      later in life. Performing in vivo microdialysis in a mouse model of
      Abeta-amyloidosis expressing human apoE isoforms (PDAPP/TRE), we find that
      the concentration and clearance of soluble Abeta in the brain interstitial
      fluid depends on the isoform of apoE expressed. This pattern parallels the
      extent of Abeta deposition observed in aged PDAPP/TRE mice. ApoE
      isoform-dependent differences in soluble Abeta metabolism are observed not
      only in aged but also in young PDAPP/TRE mice well before the onset of
      Abeta deposition in amyloid plaques in the brain. Additionally,
      amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein and Abeta synthesis,
      as assessed by in vivo stable isotopic labeling kinetics, do not vary
      according to apoE isoform in young PDAPP/TRE mice. Our results suggest
      that APOE alleles contribute to AD risk by differentially regulating
      clearance of Abeta from the brain, suggesting that Abeta clearance
      pathways may be useful therapeutic targets for AD prevention.

      Replication of BIN1 association with Alzheimer's disease and evaluation of
      genetic interactions

    pages: 751-8
    abstract: >-
      The most recent late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) genome-wide
      association study revealed genome-wide significant association of two new
      loci: rs744373 near BIN1 (p = 1.6 x 10-11) and rs597668 near
      EXOC3L2/BLOC1S3/MARK4 (p = 6.5 x 10-9). We have genotyped these variants
      in a large (3,287 LOAD, 4,396 controls), independent dataset comprising
      eleven case-control series from the USA and Europe. We performed
      meta-analyses of the association of these variants with LOAD and also
      tested for association using logistic regression adjusted by
      age-at-diagnosis, gender, and APOE epsilon4 status. Meta-analysis results
      showed no evidence of series heterogeneity and logistic regression
      analysis successfully replicated the association of BIN1 (rs744373) with
      LOAD with an odds ratio (OR = 1.17, p = 1.1 x 10-4) comparable to that
      previously reported (OR = 1.15). The variant near EXOC3L2 (rs597668)
      showed only suggestive association with LOAD (p = 0.09) after correcting
      for the presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele. Addition of our follow-up
      data to the results previously reported increased the strength of evidence
      for association with BIN1 (11,825 LOAD, 32,570 controls, rs744373 Fisher
      combined p = 3.8 x 10-20). We also tested for epistatic interaction
      between these variants and APOE epsilon4 as well as with the previously
      replicated LOAD GWAS genes (CLU: rs11136000, CR1: rs3818361, and PICALM:
      rs3851179). No significant interactions between these genes were detected.
      In summary, we provide additional evidence for the variant near BIN1
      (rs744373) as a LOAD risk modifier, but our results indicate that the
      effect of EXOC3L2 independent of APOE epsilon4 should be studied further.

      Investigation of 15 of the top candidate genes for late-onset Alzheimer's
      disease
    journal: Hum Genet
    volume: 129
    issue: 3
    pages: 273-82
    abstract: >-
      The 12 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) published to-date for
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) have identified over 40 candidate
      LOAD risk modifiers, in addition to apolipoprotein (APOE) epsilon4. A few
      of these novel LOAD candidate genes, namely BIN1, CLU, CR1, EXOC3L2 and
      PICALM, have shown consistent replication, and are thus credible LOAD
      susceptibility genes. To evaluate other promising LOAD candidate genes, we
      have added data from our large, case-control series (n=5,043) to
      meta-analyses of all published follow-up case-control association studies
      for six LOAD candidate genes that have shown significant association
      across multiple studies (TNK1, GAB2, LOC651924, GWA_14q32.13, PGBD1 and
      GALP) and for an additional nine previously suggested candidate genes.
      Meta-analyses remained significant at three loci after addition of our
      data: GAB2 (OR=0.78, p=0.007), LOC651924 (OR=0.91, p=0.01) and TNK1
      (OR=0.92, p=0.02). Breslow-Day tests revealed significant heterogeneity
      between studies for GAB2 (p&#60;0.0001) and GWA_14q32.13 (p=0.006). We
      have also provided suggestive evidence that PGBD1 (p=0.04) and EBF3
      (p=0.03) are associated with age-at-onset of LOAD. Finally, we tested for
      interactions between these 15 genes, APOE epsilon4 and the five novel LOAD
      genes BIN1, CLU, CR1, EXOC3L2 and PICALM but none were significant after
      correction for multiple testing. Overall, this large, independent
      follow-up study for 15 of the top LOAD candidate genes provides support
      for GAB2 and LOC651924 (6q24.1) as risk modifiers of LOAD and novel
      associations between PGBD1 and EBF3 with age-at-onset.

    title: A multi-center study of ACE and the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease
    journal: J Alzheimers Dis
    volume: 24
    issue: 3
    pages: 587-97
    abstract: >-
      A key pathological feature of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the
      abnormal extracellular accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide.
      Thus, altered Abeta degradation could be a major contributor to the
      development of LOAD. Variants in the gene encoding the Abeta-degrading
      enzyme, angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE) therefore represent
      plausible candidates for association with LOAD pathology and risk.
      Following Alzgene meta-analyses of all published case-control studies, the
      ACE variants rs4291 and rs1800764 showed significant association with LOAD
      risk. Furthermore ACE haplotypes are associated with both plasma ACE
      levels and LOAD risk. We tested three ACE variants (rs4291, rs4343, and
      rs1800764) for association with LOAD in ten Caucasian case-control
      populations (n = 8,212). No association was found using multiple logistic
      models (all p &#62; 0.09). We found no population heterogeneity (all p
      &#62; 0.38) or evidence for association with LOAD risk following
      meta-analysis of the ten populations for rs4343 (OR = 1.00), rs4291 (OR =
      0.97), or rs1800764 (OR = 0.99). Although we found no haplotypic
      association in our complete dataset (p = 0.51), a significant global
      haplotypic p-value was observed in one population (p = 0.007) due to an
      association of the H3 haplotype (OR = 0.72, p = 0.02) and a trend towards
      an association of H4 (OR = 1.38, p = 0.09) and H7 (OR = 2.07, p = 0.08)
      although these did not survive Bonferroni correction. Previously reported
      associations of ACE variants with LOAD will be diminished following this
      study. At best, ACE variants have modest effect sizes, which are likely
      part of a complex interaction between genetic, phenotypic and
      pharmacological effects that would be undetected in traditional
      case-control studies.

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most neurodegenerative disorder leading to
      dementia. Neuritic plaque formation in brains is a hallmark of AD
      pathogenesis. Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is the central component of
      neuritic plaques. Processing beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the
      beta-secretase site by the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is
      essential for generation of Abeta. Elevation of BACE1 activity and
      expression has been reported in AD brains. However, no mutation in the
      BACE1 coding sequence has been identified in AD cases. Human BACE1
      expression is tightly regulated at the transcription and translation
      level. To determine whether there is any single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      in the BACE1 gene promoter region affecting BACE1 expression in AD
      pathogenesis, in this study, we screened 2.6 kb of the human BACE1 gene
      promoter region from late-onset AD patients and found that there was no
      significant association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms and AD
      cases.

      Telephone assessment of cognitive function in the late-onset Alzheimer's
      disease family study

      BACKGROUND: Administration of cognitive test batteries by telephone has
      been shown to be a valid and cost-effective means of assessing cognition,
      but it remains relatively uncommon in epidemiological research.
      OBJECTIVES: To develop composite cognitive measures and assess how much of
      the variability in their scores is associated with mode of test
      administration (ie, in person or by telephone). DESIGN: Cross-sectional
      cohort study. SETTING: Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study
      conducted at 18 centers across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of
      1584 persons, 368 with dementia, from 646 families. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Scores on composite measures of memory and cognitive function derived from
      a battery of 7 performance tests administered in person (69%) or by
      telephone (31%) by examiners who underwent a structured performance-based
      training program with annual recertification. RESULTS: Based in part on
      the results of a factor analysis of the 7 tests, we developed summary
      measures of working memory, declarative memory, episodic memory, semantic
      memory, and global cognition. In linear regression analyses, mode of test
      administration accounted for less than 2% of the variance in the measures.
      In mixed-effects models, variability in cognitive scores due to center was
      small relative to variability due to differences between individuals and
      families. CONCLUSIONS: In epidemiologic research on aging and Alzheimer
      disease, assessment of cognition by telephone has little effect on
      performance and provides operational flexibility and a means of reducing
      both costs and missing data.

      OBJECTIVE:: To characterize change in depressive symptoms before and after
      the onset of dementia in Alzheimer disease (AD). METHOD:: We used data
      from the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a longitudinal cohort study of
      risk factors for AD in a geographically defined population of old people.
      Two subsets were analyzed. In 357 individuals who developed incident AD
      during the study, self-report of depressive symptoms (Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) was obtained at 3-year intervals
      for a mean of 8 to 9 years. In 340 individuals who agreed to annual data
      collection, informant report of depressive symptoms (Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale) was obtained for a mean of 3 years after a diagnosis of AD
      (n = 107), mild cognitive impairment (n = 81), or no cognitive impairment
      (n = 152). RESULTS:: The incident AD group reported a barely perceptible
      increase in depressive symptoms during 6 to 7 years of observation before
      the diagnosis (0.04 symptoms per year) and no change during 2 to 3 years
      of observation after the diagnosis except for a slight decrease in
      positive affect. In those with annual follow-up, neither AD nor its
      precursor, mild cognitive impairment, was associated with change in
      informant report of depressive symptoms during a mean of 3 years of
      observation. CONCLUSION:: Depressive symptoms show little change during
      the development and progression of AD to a moderate level of dementia
      severity. GLOSSARY: AD = Alzheimer disease; CES-D = Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; MCI = mild cognitive impairment.

      Neuroglobin and Alzheimer's dementia: genetic association and gene
      expression changes
    journal: Neurobiol Aging
    volume: 31
    issue: 11
    pages: 1835-42
    abstract: >-
      We previously reported strong genetic linkage on chromosome 14q to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the presence of co-morbid hallucinations as
      a covariate. Those results suggested the presence of a gene increasing the
      risk for a genetically homogeneous form of AD characterized by the absence
      of comorbid hallucinations. Here we report our follow up of that study
      through the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five
      functional candidate genes. This work provides significant evidence of
      association for the gene coding for neuroglobin (NGB), a nervous system
      globin known to protect cells against amyloid toxicity and to attenuate
      the AD phenotype of transgenic mice. On further experiments we found that
      NGB expression is reduced with increasing age and lower in women
      consistent with their increased risk. NGB expression is up-regulated in
      the temporal lobe of AD patients consistent with a response to the disease
      process, as reported for NGB and hypoxia. We speculate that a compromised
      response due to DNA variation might increase the risk for AD. Our and
      others' data strongly support the involvement of NGB in AD.

      Assessment and familial aggregation of psychosis in Alzheimer's disease
      from the National Institute on Aging Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family
      Study

      Determining the genetic architecture of late onset Alzheimer's disease
      remains an important research objective. One approach to the
      identification of novel genetic variants contributing to the disease is
      the classification of biologically meaningful subgroups within the larger
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease phenotype. The occurrence of psychotic
      symptoms in patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease may identify one
      such group. We attempted to establish methods for the reliable assessment
      of psychotic symptoms in a large, geographically dispersed collection of
      families, multiply affected with late onset Alzheimer's disease, who were
      participants in the larger National Institute on Aging Late Onset
      Alzheimer's Disease Family Study; and to characterize the correlates and
      familial aggregation of psychosis within this cohort. We found that
      reliable assessments of psychotic symptoms during in-person or phone
      interviews were readily implemented. The presence of psychosis in late
      onset Alzheimer's disease was significantly associated with degree of
      cognitive impairment, and significantly, albeit modestly, correlated with
      the severity of other behavioural symptoms. Psychosis significantly
      aggregated within late onset Alzheimer's disease families suggesting that
      it may identify a genetically determined subgroup. Future studies should
      examine the linkage and association of psychosis with genetic variation
      within these families.

      Genome-wide analysis reveals novel genes influencing temporal lobe
      structure with relevance to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Neuroimage
    volume: 51
    issue: 2
    pages: 542-54
    abstract: >-
      In a genome-wide association study of structural brain degeneration, we
      mapped the 3D profile of temporal lobe volume differences in 742 brain MRI
      scans of Alzheimer's disease patients, mildly impaired, and healthy
      elderly subjects. After searching 546,314 genomic markers, 2 single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with bilateral temporal
      lobe volume (P&#60;5 x 10(-7)). One SNP, rs10845840, is located in the
      GRIN2B gene which encodes the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate
      receptor NR2B subunit. This protein - involved in learning and memory, and
      excitotoxic cell death - has age-dependent prevalence in the synapse and
      is already a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. Risk alleles for
      lower temporal lobe volume at this SNP were significantly over-represented
      in AD and MCI subjects vs. controls (odds ratio=1.273; P=0.039) and were
      associated with mini-mental state exam scores (MMSE; t=-2.114; P=0.035)
      demonstrating a negative effect on global cognitive function. Voxelwise
      maps of genetic association of this SNP with regional brain volumes,
      revealed intense temporal lobe effects (FDR correction at q=0.05; critical
      P=0.0257). This study uses large-scale brain mapping for gene discovery
      with implications for Alzheimer's disease.

    abstract: >-
      The structure of the human brain is highly heritable, and is thought to be
      influenced by many common genetic variants, many of which are currently
      unknown. Recent advances in neuroimaging and genetics have allowed
      collection of both highly detailed structural brain scans and genome-wide
      genotype information. This wealth of information presents a new
      opportunity to find the genes influencing brain structure. Here we explore
      the relation between 448,293 single nucleotide polymorphisms in each of
      31,622 voxels of the entire brain across 740 elderly subjects (mean
      age+/-s.d.: 75.52+/-6.82 years; 438 male) including subjects with
      Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and healthy elderly
      controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We
      used tensor-based morphometry to measure individual differences in brain
      structure at the voxel level relative to a study-specific template based
      on healthy elderly subjects. We then conducted a genome-wide association
      at each voxel to identify genetic variants of interest. By studying only
      the most associated variant at each voxel, we developed a novel method to
      address the multiple comparisons problem and computational burden
      associated with the unprecedented amount of data. No variant survived the
      strict significance criterion, but several genes worthy of further
      exploration were identified, including CSMD2 and CADPS2. These genes have
      high relevance to brain structure. This is the first voxelwise genome wide
      association study to our knowledge, and offers a novel method to discover
      genetic influences on brain structure.

      Whole genome association study of brain-wide imaging phenotypes for
      identifying quantitative trait loci in MCI and AD: A study of the ADNI
      cohort
    journal: Neuroimage
    volume: 53
    issue: 3
    pages: 1051-63
    abstract: >-
      A genome-wide, whole brain approach to investigate genetic effects on
      neuroimaging phenotypes for identifying quantitative trait loci is
      described. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1.5 T MRI and
      genetic dataset was investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and
      FreeSurfer parcellation followed by genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS). One hundred forty-two measures of grey matter (GM) density,
      volume, and cortical thickness were extracted from baseline scans. GWAS,
      using PLINK, were performed on each phenotype using quality-controlled
      genotype and scan data including 530,992 of 620,903 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and 733 of 818 participants (175 AD, 354 amnestic
      mild cognitive impairment, MCI, and 204 healthy controls, HC).
      Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the GWAS
      results and associations are reported at two significance thresholds
      (p&#60;10(-7) and p&#60;10(-6)). As expected, SNPs in the APOE and TOMM40
      genes were confirmed as markers strongly associated with multiple brain
      regions. Other top SNPs were proximal to the EPHA4, TP63 and NXPH1 genes.
      Detailed image analyses of rs6463843 (flanking NXPH1) revealed reduced
      global and regional GM density across diagnostic groups in TT relative to
      GG homozygotes. Interaction analysis indicated that AD patients homozygous
      for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right hippocampal GM
      density loss. NXPH1 codes for a protein implicated in promotion of
      adhesion between dendrites and axons, a key factor in synaptic integrity,
      the loss of which is a hallmark of AD. A genome-wide, whole brain search
      strategy has the potential to reveal novel candidate genes and loci
      warranting further investigation and replication.

    abstract: >-
      CONTEXT: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified
      CLU, PICALM, and CR1 as novel genes for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD).
      OBJECTIVES: To identify and strengthen additional loci associated with AD
      and confirm these in an independent sample and to examine the contribution
      of recently identified genes to AD risk prediction in a 3-stage analysis
      of new and previously published GWAS on more than 35,000 persons (8371 AD
      cases). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In stage 1, we identified
      strong genetic associations (P &#60; 10(-3)) in a sample of 3006 AD cases
      and 14,642 controls by combining new data from the population-based
      Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium
      (1367 AD cases [973 incident]) with previously reported results from the
      Translational Genomics Research Institute and the Mayo AD GWAS. We
      identified 2708 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P &#60;
      10(-3). In stage 2, we pooled results for these SNPs with the European AD
      Initiative (2032 cases and 5328 controls) to identify 38 SNPs (10 loci)
      with P &#60; 10(-5). In stage 3, we combined data for these 10 loci with
      data from the Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD consortium (3333 cases
      and 6995 controls) to identify 4 SNPs with P &#60; 1.7x10(-8). These 4
      SNPs were replicated in an independent Spanish sample (1140 AD cases and
      1209 controls). Genome-wide association analyses were completed in
      2007-2008 and the meta-analyses and replication in 2009. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE: Presence of Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: Two loci were identified
      to have genome-wide significance for the first time: rs744373 near BIN1
      (odds ratio [OR],1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.06-1.21 per copy of
      the minor allele; P = 1.59x10(-11)) and rs597668 near
      EXOC3L2/BLOC1S3/MARK4 (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07-1.29; P = 6.45x10(-9)).
      Associations of these 2 loci plus the previously identified loci CLU and
      PICALM with AD were confirmed in the Spanish sample (P &#60; .05).
      However, although CLU and PICALM were confirmed to be associated with AD
      in this independent sample, they did not improve the ability of a model
      that included age, sex, and APOE to predict incident AD (improvement in
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.847 to 0.849
      in the Rotterdam Study and 0.702 to 0.705 in the Cardiovascular Health
      Study). CONCLUSIONS: Two genetic loci for AD were found for the first time
      to reach genome-wide statistical significance. These findings were
      replicated in an independent population. Two recently reported
      associations were also confirmed. These loci did not improve AD risk
      prediction. While not clinically useful, they may implicate biological
      pathways useful for future research.

      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative biomarkers as quantitative
      phenotypes: Genetics core aims, progress, and plans

    volume: 6
    issue: 3

    abstract: >-
      The role of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Genetics Core
      is to facilitate the investigation of genetic influences on disease onset
      and trajectory as reflected in structural, functional, and molecular
      imaging changes; fluid biomarkers; and cognitive status. Major goals
      include (1) blood sample processing, genotyping, and dissemination, (2)
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of longitudinal phenotypic data,
      and (3) providing a central resource, point of contact and planning group
      for genetics within the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.
      Genome-wide array data have been publicly released and updated, and
      several neuroimaging GWAS have recently been reported examining baseline
      magnetic resonance imaging measures as quantitative phenotypes. Other
      preliminary investigations include copy number variation in mild cognitive
      impairment and Alzheimer's disease and GWAS of baseline cerebrospinal
      fluid biomarkers and longitudinal changes on magnetic resonance imaging.
      Blood collection for RNA studies is a new direction. Genetic studies of
      longitudinal phenotypes hold promise for elucidating disease mechanisms
      and risk, development of therapeutic strategies, and refining selection
      criteria for clinical trials.

      Atrophic changes in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) have been proposed as biomarkers for detection
      and monitoring. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atrophy rate
      from baseline to 1 year in 4 groups of participants from the Alzheimer's
      Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): AD (n = 152), converters from MCI
      to probable AD (MCI-C, n = 60), stable MCI (MCI-S, n = 261), and healthy
      controls (HC, n = 200). Scans were analyzed using multiple methods,
      including voxel-based morphometry (VBM), regions of interest (ROIs), and
      automated parcellation, permitting comparison of annual percent change
      (APC) in neurodegeneration markers. Effect sizes and the sample required
      to detect 25% reduction in atrophy rates were calculated. The influence of
      APOE genotype on APC was also evaluated. AD patients and converters from
      MCI to probable AD demonstrated high atrophy APCs across regions compared
      with minimal change in healthy controls. Stable MCI subjects showed
      intermediate atrophy rates. APOE genotype was associated with APC in key
      regions. In sum, APC rates are influenced by APOE genotype, imminent MCI
      to AD conversion, and AD-related neurodegeneration.

      Sex-dependent association of common variants of microcephaly genes with
      brain structure
    journal: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A

    pages: 384-8
    abstract: >-
      Loss-of-function mutations in the genes associated with primary
      microcephaly (MCPH) reduce human brain size by about two-thirds, without
      producing gross abnormalities in brain organization or physiology and
      leaving other organs largely unaffected [Woods CG, et al. (2005) Am J Hum
      Genet 76:717-728]. There is also evidence suggesting that MCPH genes have
      evolved rapidly in primates and humans and have been subjected to
      selection in recent human evolution [Vallender EJ, et al. (2008) Trends
      Neurosci 31:637-644]. Here, we show that common variants of MCPH genes
      account for some of the common variation in brain structure in humans,
      independently of disease status. We investigated the correlations of SNPs
      from four MCPH genes with brain morphometry phenotypes obtained with MRI.
      We found significant, sex-specific associations between common, nonexonic,
      SNPs of the genes CDK5RAP2, MCPH1, and ASPM, with brain volume or cortical
      surface area in an ethnically homogenous Norwegian discovery sample (n =
      287), including patients with mental illness. The most strongly associated
      SNP findings were replicated in an independent North American sample (n =
      656), which included patients with dementia. These results are consistent
      with the view that common variation in brain structure is associated with
      genetic variants located in nonexonic, presumably regulatory, regions.

      A genome screen of successful aging without cognitive decline identifies
      LRP1B by haplotype analysis

    abstract: >-
      Successful aging without cognitive decline (SA) is apparent in those who
      escape age-related illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and dementia.
      To determine whether there are protective genotypes that increase the
      probability of successful cognitive aging, a genome-wide screen was
      conducted on subjects who were 85 years of older, had MMSE scores &#62;26,
      and had no major illnesses. SNP 500K microarrays were used. The data from
      the microarrays was analyzed versus that from Alzheimer's patients. Three
      SNPs in the gene for the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
      1B (LRP1B) had significant P values, after Bonferroni correction.
      Additional SNPs were analyzed in this very large gene. Haplotypes in
      intron 18 were significant for successful aging versus Alzheimer's
      patients; those haplotypes were not significant when Alzheimer's patients
      versus CEPH controls were analyzed. These results suggest that haplotypes
      in the gene LRP1B are significant/protective for successful aging without
      cognitive decline.

      Visualizing disease associations: graphic analysis of frequency
      distributions as a function of age using moving average plots (MAP) with
      application to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease
    journal: Genet Epidemiol
    volume: 34
    issue: 1
    pages: 92-9
    abstract: >-
      Age-related variation in marker frequency can be a confounder in
      association studies, leading to both false-positive and false-negative
      findings and subsequently to inconsistent reproducibility. We have
      developed a simple method, based on a novel extension of moving average
      plots (MAP), which allows investigators to inspect the frequency data for
      hidden age-related variations. MAP uses the standard case-control
      association data and generates a birds-eye view of the frequency
      distributions across the age spectrum; a picture in which one can see if,
      how, and when the marker frequencies in cases differ from that in
      controls. The marker can be specified as an allele, genotype, haplotype,
      or environmental factor; and age can be age-at-onset, age when subject was
      last known to be unaffected, or duration of exposure. Signature patterns
      that emerge can help distinguish true disease associations from spurious
      associations due to age effects, age-varying associations from
      associations that are uniform across all ages, and associations with risk
      from associations with age-at-onset. Utility of MAP is illustrated by
      application to genetic and epidemiological association data for
      Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. MAP is intended as a descriptive
      method, to complement standard statistical techniques. Although originally
      developed for age patterns, MAP is equally useful for visualizing any
      quantitative trait.

      Familial Alzheimer's disease mutations in presenilins: effects on
      endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis and correlation with clinical
      phenotypes
    journal: J Alzheimers Dis
    volume: 21
    issue: 3
    pages: 781-93
    abstract: >-
      Mutations in presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) are responsible for
      approximately 40% of all early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)
      monogenic cases. Presenilins (PSs) function as the catalytic subunit of
      gamma-secretase and support cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor
      (AbetaPP). We previously discovered that PSs also function as passive
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) leak channels and that most FAD
      mutations in PSs affected their ER Ca2+ leak function. To further validate
      the relevance of our findings to human disease, we here performed Ca2+
      imaging experiments with lymphoblasts established from FAD patients. We
      discovered that most FAD mutations in PSs disrupted ER Ca2+ leak function
      and resulted in increased ER Ca2+ pool in human lymphoblasts. However, we
      found that a subset of PS1 FAD mutants supported ER Ca2+ leak activity, as
      ER Ca2+ pool was unaffected in lymphoblasts. Most of the
      &#34;functional&#34; mutations for ER Ca2+ leak were clustered in the exon
      8-9 area of PSEN1 gene and segregated with the cotton wool plaques and
      spastic paraparesis clinical phenotype occasionally observed in PS1 FAD
      patients. Our findings with the &#34;functional&#34; and
      &#34;non-functional&#34; PS1 FAD mutants were confirmed in Ca2+ rescue
      experiments with PS double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Based on
      the combined effects of the PS1 FAD mutations on ER Ca2+ leak and
      gamma-secretase activities we propose a model that explains the
      heterogeneity observed in FAD. The proposed model has implications for
      understanding the pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic AD.

      Dementia revealed: novel chromosome 6 locus for late-onset Alzheimer
      disease provides genetic evidence for folate-pathway abnormalities
    journal: PLoS Genet
    volume: 6
    issue: 9
    pages: ""
    abstract: >-
      Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer disease
      (LOAD) have consistently observed strong evidence of association with
      polymorphisms in APOE. However, until recently, variants at few other loci
      with statistically significant associations have replicated across
      studies. The present study combines data on 483,399 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) from a previously reported GWAS of 492 LOAD cases and
      496 controls and from an independent set of 439 LOAD cases and 608
      controls to strengthen power to identify novel genetic association
      signals. Associations exceeding the experiment-wide significance threshold
      (alpha=1.03x10(-7)) were replicated in an additional 1,338 cases and 2,003
      controls. As expected, these analyses unequivocally confirmed APOE's risk
      effect (rs2075650, P=1.9x10(-36)). Additionally, the SNP rs11754661 at
      151.2 Mb of chromosome 6q25.1 in the gene MTHFD1L (which encodes the
      methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1-like protein)
      was significantly associated with LOAD (P=4.70x10(-8);
      Bonferroni-corrected P=0.022). Subsequent genotyping of SNPs in high
      linkage disequilibrium (r2&#62;0.8) with rs11754661 identified
      statistically significant associations in multiple SNPs (rs803424,
      P=0.016; rs2073067, P=0.03; rs2072064, P=0.035), reducing the likelihood
      of association due to genotyping error. In the replication case-control
      set, we observed an association of rs11754661 in the same direction as the
      previous association at P=0.002 (P=1.90x10(-10) in combined analysis of
      discovery and replication sets), with associations of similar statistical
      significance at several adjacent SNPs (rs17349743, P=0.005; rs803422,
      P=0.004). In summary, we observed and replicated a novel statistically
      significant association in MTHFD1L, a gene involved in the
      tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway. This finding is noteworthy, as MTHFD1L
      may play a role in the generation of methionine from homocysteine and
      influence homocysteine-related pathways and as levels of homocysteine are
      a significant risk factor for LOAD development.

      Association between mitochondrial DNA variations and Alzheimer's disease
      in the ADNI cohort
    journal: Neurobiol Aging
    volume: 31
    issue: 8
    pages: 1355-63
    abstract: >-
      Despite the central role of amyloid deposition in the development of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the pathogenesis of AD still remains elusive at
      the molecular level. Increasing evidence suggests that compromised
      mitochondrial function contributes to the aging process and thus may
      increase the risk of AD. Dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) which can lead to extensive macromolecule oxidative
      damage and the progression of amyloid pathology. Oxidative stress and
      amyloid toxicity leave neurons chemically vulnerable. Because the brain
      relies on aerobic metabolism, it is apparent that mitochondria are
      critical for the cerebral function. Mitochondrial DNA sequence changes
      could shift cell dynamics and facilitate neuronal vulnerability. Therefore
      we postulated that mitochondrial DNA sequence polymorphisms may increase
      the risk of AD. We evaluated the role of mitochondrial haplogroups derived
      from 138 mitochondrial polymorphisms in 358 Caucasian Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects. Our results indicate that the
      mitochondrial haplogroup UK may confer genetic susceptibility to AD
      independently of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele.

      Validating predicted biological effects of Alzheimer's disease associated

    journal: J Alzheimers Dis
    volume: 21
    issue: 3
    pages: 833-42
    abstract: >-
      Recent large-scale genetic studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease have
      identified risk variants in CALHM1, GAB2, and SORL1. The mechanisms by
      which these genes might modulate risk are not definitively known. CALHM1
      and SORL1 may alter amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and GAB2 may influence
      phosphorylation of the tau protein. In this study we have analyzed disease
      associated genetic variants in each of these genes for association with
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta or tau levels in 602 samples from two
      independent CSF series. We failed to detect association between CSF
      Abeta42 levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms in SORL1 despite
      substantial statistical power to detect association. While we also failed
      to detect association between variants in GAB2 and CSF tau levels, power
      to detect this association was limited. Finally, our data suggest that the
      minor allele of rs2986017, in CALHM1, is marginally associated with CSF
      Abeta42 levels. This association is consistent with previous reports that
      this non-synonymous coding substitution results in increased Abeta levels
      in vitro and provides support for an Abeta-related mechanism for
      modulating risk for Alzheimer's disease.

      Suggestive synergy between genetic variants in TF and HFE as risk factors

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease that is likely influenced by
      many genetic and environmental factors. Citing evidence that iron may play
      a role in AD pathology, Robson et al. [Robson et al. (2004); J Med Genet
      41:261-265] reported that epistatic interaction between rs1049296 (P589S)
      in the transferrin gene (TF) and rs1800562 (C282Y) in the hemochromatosis
      gene (HFE) results in significant association with risk for AD. In this
      study we attempted to replicate their findings in a total of 1,166 cases
      and 1,404 controls from three European and European American populations.
      Allele and genotype frequencies were consistent across the three
      populations. Using synergy factor analysis (SFA) and Logistic Regression
      analysis we tested each population and the combined sample for
      interactions between these two SNPs and risk for AD. We observed
      significant association between bi-carriers of the minor alleles of
      rs1049296 and rs1800562 in the combined sample using SFA (P = 0.0016,
      synergy factor = 2.71) and adjusted SFA adjusting for age and presence of
      the APOE epsilon 4 allele (P = 0.002, OR = 2.4). These results validate
      those of the previous report and support the hypothesis that iron
      transport and regulation play a role in AD pathology.

    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVES: To determine whether genotypes at CLU, PICALM, and CR1 confer
      risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) and whether risk for AD associated with
      these genes is influenced by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes. DESIGN:
      Association study of AD and CLU, PICALM, CR1, and APOE genotypes. SETTING:
      Academic research institutions in the United States, Canada, and Israel.
      PARTICIPANTS: Seven thousand seventy cases with AD, 3055 with autopsies,
      and 8169 elderly cognitively normal controls, 1092 with autopsies, from 12
      different studies, including white, African American, Israeli-Arab, and
      Caribbean Hispanic individuals. RESULTS: Unadjusted, CLU (odds ratio [OR],
      0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.96 for single-nucleotide
      polymorphism [SNP] rs11136000), CR1 (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07-1.22; SNP
      rs3818361), and PICALM (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94, SNP rs3851179) were
      associated with AD in white individuals. None were significantly
      associated with AD in the other ethnic groups. APOE epsilon4 was
      significantly associated with AD (ORs, 1.80-9.05) in all but 1 small white
      cohort and in the Arab cohort. Adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of
      at least 1 APOE epsilon4 allele greatly reduced evidence for association
      with PICALM but not CR1 or CLU. Models with the main SNP effect, presence
      or absence of APOE epsilon4, and an interaction term showed significant
      interaction between presence or absence of APOE epsilon4 and PICALM.
      CONCLUSIONS: We confirm in a completely independent data set that CR1,
      CLU, and PICALM are AD susceptibility loci in European ancestry
      populations. Genotypes at PICALM confer risk predominantly in APOE
      epsilon4-positive subjects. Thus, APOE and PICALM synergistically
      interact.

      A commonly carried allele of the obesity-related FTO gene is associated
      with reduced brain volume in the healthy elderly
    journal: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
    volume: 107
    issue: 18
    pages: 8404-9
    abstract: >-
      A recently identified variant within the fat mass and obesity-associated
      (FTO) gene is carried by 46% of Western Europeans and is associated with
      an approximately 1.2 kg higher weight, on average, in adults and an
      approximately 1 cm greater waist circumference. With &#62;1 billion
      overweight and 300 million obese persons worldwide, it is crucial to
      understand the implications of carrying this very common allele for the
      health of our aging population. FTO is highly expressed in the brain and
      elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with brain atrophy, but it is
      unknown how the obesity-associated risk allele affects human brain
      structure. We therefore generated 3D maps of regional brain volume
      differences in 206 healthy elderly subjects scanned with MRI and genotyped
      as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found a
      pattern of systematic brain volume deficits in carriers of the
      obesity-associated risk allele versus noncarriers. Relative to structure
      volumes in the mean template, FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers
      had an average brain volume difference of approximately 8% in the frontal
      lobes and 12% in the occipital lobes-these regions also showed significant
      volume deficits in subjects with higher BMI. These brain differences were
      not attributable to differences in cholesterol levels, hypertension, or
      the volume of white matter hyperintensities; which were not detectably
      higher in FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers. These brain maps
      reveal that a commonly carried susceptibility allele for obesity is
      associated with structural brain atrophy, with implications for the health
      of the elderly.

      Genome-wide association reveals genetic effects on human Abeta42 and tau
      protein levels in cerebrospinal fluids: a case control study
    journal: BMC Neurol
    volume: 10
    issue: ""
    pages: 90
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is common and highly heritable with
      many genes and gene variants associated with AD in one or more studies,
      including APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4. However, the genetic
      backgrounds for normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD
      in terms of changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta1-42,
      T-tau, and P-tau181P, have not been clearly delineated. We carried out a
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to better define the genetic
      backgrounds to these three states in relation to CSF levels. METHODS:
      Subjects were participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI). The GWAS dataset consisted of 818 participants (mainly
      Caucasian) genotyped using the Illumina Human Genome 610 Quad BeadChips.
      This sample included 410 subjects (119 Normal, 115 MCI and 176 AD) with
      measurements of CSF Abeta1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181P Levels. We used PLINK
      to find genetic associations with the three CSF biomarker levels.
      Association of each of the 498,205 SNPs was tested using additive,
      dominant, and general association models while considering APOE genotype
      and age. Finally, an effort was made to better identify relevant
      biochemical pathways for associated genes using the ALIGATOR software.
      RESULTS: We found that there were some associations with APOE genotype
      although CSF levels were about the same for each subject group; CSF
      Abeta1-42 levels decreased with APOE gene dose for each subject group.
      T-tau levels tended to be higher among AD cases than among normal
      subjects. From adjusted result using APOE genotype and age as covariates,
      no SNP was associated with CSF levels among AD subjects. CYP19A1
      'aromatase' (rs2899472), NCAM2, and multiple SNPs located on chromosome 10
      near the ARL5B gene demonstrated the strongest associations with Abeta1-42
      in normal subjects. Two genes found to be near the top SNPs, CYP19A1
      (rs2899472, p = 1.90 x 10(-7)) and NCAM2 (rs1022442, p = 2.75 x 10(-7))
      have been reported as genetic factors related to the progression of AD
      from previous studies. In AD subjects, APOE epsilon2/epsilon3 and
      epsilon2/epsilon4 genotypes were associated with elevated T-tau levels and
      epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype was associated with elevated T-tau and
      P-tau181P levels. Pathway analysis detected several biological pathways
      implicated in Normal with CSF beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta1-42).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our genome-wide association analysis identified several SNPs
      as important factors for CSF biomarker. We also provide new evidence for
      additional candidate genetic risk factors from pathway analysis that can
      be tested in further studies.

      Fine mapping of the chromosome 10q11-q21 linkage region in Alzheimer's
      disease cases and controls
    journal: Neurogenetics
    volume: 11
    issue: 3
    pages: 335-48
    abstract: >-
      We have previously reported strong linkage on chromosome 10q in pedigrees
      transmitting Alzheimer's disease through the mother, overlapping with many
      significant linkage reports including the largest reported study. Here, we
      report the most comprehensive fine mapping of this region to date. In a
      sample of 638 late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) cases and controls
      including 104 maternal LOAD cases, we genotyped 3,884 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 15.2 Mb. We then used imputations and
      publicly available data to generate an extended dataset including 4,329
      SNPs for 1,209 AD cases and 839 controls in the same region. Further, we
      screened eight genes in this region for rare alleles in 283 individuals by
      nucleotide sequencing, and we tested for possible monoallelic expression
      as it might underlie our maternal parent of origin linkage. We excluded
      the possibility of multiple rare coding risk variants for these genes and
      monoallelic expression when we could test for it. One SNP, rs10824310 in
      the PRKG1 gene, showed study-wide significant association without a parent
      of origin effect, but the effect size estimate is not of sufficient
      magnitude to explain the linkage, and no association is observed in an
      independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) report. Further, no
      causative variants were identified though sequencing. Analysis of cases
      with maternal disease origin pointed to a few regions of interest that
      included the genes PRKG1 and PCDH15 and an intergenic interval of 200 Kb.
      It is likely that non-transcribed rare variants or other mechanisms
      involving these genomic regions underlie the observed linkage and parent
      of origin effect. Acquiring additional support and clarifying the
      mechanisms of such involvement is important for AD and other complex
      disorder genetics research.

      Genome-wide association study confirms SNPs in SNCA and the MAPT region as
      common risk factors for Parkinson disease
    journal: Ann Hum Genet
    volume: 74
    issue: 2
    pages: 97-109
    abstract: >-
      Parkinson disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a
      cumulative prevalence of greater than one per thousand. To date three
      independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have investigated the
      genetic susceptibility to PD. These studies implicated several genes as PD
      risk loci with strong, but not genome-wide significant, associations. In
      this study, we combined data from two previously published GWAS of
      Caucasian subjects with our GWAS of 604 cases and 619 controls for a joint
      analysis with a combined sample size of 1752 cases and 1745 controls. SNPs
      in SNCA (rs2736990, p-value = 6.7 x 10(-8); genome-wide adjusted p =
      0.0109, odds ratio (OR) = 1.29 [95% CI: 1.17-1.42] G vs. A allele,
      population attributable risk percent (PAR%) = 12%) and the MAPT region
      (rs11012, p-value = 5.6 x 10(-8); genome-wide adjusted p = 0.0079, OR =
      0.70 [95% CI: 0.62-0.79] T vs. C allele, PAR%= 8%) were genome-wide
      significant. No other SNPs were genome-wide significant in this analysis.
      This study confirms that SNCA and the MAPT region are major genes whose
      common variants are influencing risk of PD.

      Concordant association of insulin degrading enzyme gene (IDE) variants
      with IDE mRNA, Abeta, and Alzheimer's disease
    journal: PLoS One
    volume: 5
    issue: 1
    pages: e8764
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: The insulin-degrading enzyme gene (IDE) is a strong functional
      and positional candidate for late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined conserved regions of IDE and
      its 10 kb flanks in 269 AD cases and 252 controls thereby identifying 17
      putative functional polymorphisms. These variants formed eleven haplotypes
      that were tagged with ten variants. Four of these showed significant
      association with IDE transcript levels in samples from 194 LOAD cerebella.
      The strongest, rs6583817, which has not previously been reported, showed
      unequivocal association (p = 1.5x10(-8), fold-increase = 2.12,); the
      eleven haplotypes were also significantly associated with transcript
      levels (global p = 0.003). Using an in vitro dual luciferase reporter
      assay, we found that rs6583817 increases reporter gene expression in
      Be(2)-C (p = 0.006) and HepG2 (p = 0.02) cell lines. Furthermore, using
      data from a recent genome-wide association study of two Croatian isolated
      populations (n = 1,879), we identified a proxy for rs6583817 that
      associated significantly with decreased plasma Abeta40 levels (ss =
      -0.124, p = 0.011) and total measured plasma Abeta levels (b = -0.130, p =
      0.009). Finally, rs6583817 was associated with decreased risk of LOAD in
      3,891 AD cases and 3,605 controls. (OR = 0.87, p = 0.03), and the eleven
      IDE haplotypes (global p = 0.02) also showed significant association.
      CONCLUSIONS: Thus, a previously unreported variant unequivocally
      associated with increased IDE expression was also associated with reduced
      plasma Abeta40 and decreased LOAD susceptibility. Genetic association
      between LOAD and IDE has been difficult to replicate. Our findings suggest
      that targeted testing of expression SNPs (eSNPs) strongly associated with
      altered transcript levels in autopsy brain samples may be a powerful way
      to identify genetic associations with LOAD that would otherwise be
      difficult to detect.

    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: To test for replication of the association between variants in
      the CLU, CR1, and PICALM genes with Alzheimer disease. DESIGN: Follow-up
      case-control association study. SETTING: The Mayo Clinics at Jacksonville,
      Florida, and Rochester, Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: Community-based patients
      of European descent with late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) and controls
      without dementia who were seen at the Mayo clinics, and autopsy-confirmed
      cases and controls whose pathology was evaluated at the Mayo Clinic in
      Jacksonville. Additional samples were obtained from the National Cell
      Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NCRAD). A total of 1829 LOAD cases and
      2576 controls were analyzed. INTERVENTIONS: The most significant
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CLU (rs11136000), CR1 (rs3818361), and
      PICALM (rs3851179) were tested for allelic association with LOAD. Main
      Outcome Measure Clinical or pathology-confirmed diagnosis of LOAD.
      RESULTS: Odds ratios for CLU, CR1, and PICALM were 0.82, 1.15, and 0.80,
      respectively, comparable in direction and magnitude with those originally
      reported. P values were 8.6 x 10(-5), .014, and 1.3 x 10(-5),
      respectively; they remain significant even after Bonferroni correction for
      the 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms tested. CONCLUSION: These results
      show near-perfect replication and provide the first additional evidence
      that CLU, CR1, and PICALM are associated with the risk of LOAD.

      Use of anticholinergics and the risk of cognitive impairment in an African
      American population
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 75
    issue: 2
    pages: 152-9
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Anticholinergic properties of certain medications often go
      unrecognized, and are frequently used by the elderly population. Few
      studies have yet defined the long-term impact of these medications on the
      incidence of cognitive impairment. METHODS: We report a 6-year
      longitudinal, observational study, evaluating 1,652 community-dwelling
      African American subjects over the age of 70 years who were enrolled in
      the Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project between 2001 and 2007 and who had
      normal cognitive function at baseline. The exposure group included those
      who reported the baseline use of possible or definite anticholinergics as
      determined by the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden scale. Our main outcome
      measure was the incidence of cognitive impairment, defined as either
      dementia or cognitive impairment not dementia, or poor performance on a
      dementia screening instrument during the follow-up period. RESULTS: At
      baseline, 53% of the population used a possible anticholinergic, and 11%
      used a definite anticholinergic. After adjusting for age, gender,
      educational level, and baseline cognitive performance, the number of
      definite anticholinergics was associated with an increased risk of
      cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]
      1.07-1.99; p = 0.02), whereas the number of possible anticholinergics at
      baseline did not increase the risk (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85-1.09; p = 0.55).
      The risk of cognitive impairment among definite anticholinergic users was
      increased if they were not carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele (OR 1.77,
      95% CI 1.03-3.05; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Limiting the clinical use of
      definite anticholinergics may reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment
      among African Americans.

    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether genome-wide association study
      (GWAS)-validated and GWAS-promising candidate loci influence magnetic
      resonance imaging measures and clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) status.
      DESIGN: Multicenter case-control study of genetic and neuroimaging data
      from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. SETTING: Multicenter
      GWAS. Patients A total of 168 individuals with probable AD, 357 with mild
      cognitive impairment, and 215 cognitively normal control individuals
      recruited from more than 50 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      centers in the United States and Canada. All study participants had APOE
      and genome-wide genetic data available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We
      investigated the influence of GWAS-validated and GWAS-promising novel AD
      loci on hippocampal volume, amygdala volume, white matter lesion volume,
      entorhinal cortex thickness, parahippocampal gyrus thickness, and temporal
      pole cortex thickness. RESULTS: Markers at the APOE locus were associated
      with all phenotypes except white matter lesion volume (all false discovery
      rate-corrected P values &#60; .001). Novel and established AD loci
      identified by prior GWASs showed a significant cumulative score-based
      effect (false discovery rate P = .04) on all analyzed neuroimaging
      measures. The GWAS-validated variants at the CR1 and PICALM loci and
      markers at 2 novel loci (BIN1 and CNTN5) showed association with multiple
      magnetic resonance imaging characteristics (false discovery rate P &#60;
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: Loci associated with AD also influence neuroimaging
      correlates of this disease. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis identified
      2 additional loci of high interest for further study.

      PCDH11X variation is not associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease

      A recent genome-wide association study and follow-up shows significant
      association with the protocadherin 11 X-linked (PCDH11X) gene.
      Carrasquillo et al. (2009) show statistical association with four PCDH11X
      polymorphisms (rs5984894, rs2573905, rs5941047, rs4568761) in five of
      seven cohorts. The combined analysis of 2356 cases and 2384 controls
      showed the strongest association with a P value of 2.2x10 with an
      allele-specific odds ratio of 1.30 (95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.43) at
      the rs5984894 polymorphism. We tested for association at these four single
      nucleotide polymorphisms in two independent datasets and then performed a
      joint analysis. Although we had adequate power to detect effect sizes with
      the reported odds ratios, we did not detect association between late-onset
      Alzheimer disease and the PCDH11X polymorphisms in our dataset of 889
      cases and 850 controls, indicating that the PCDH11X association, if not a
      false positive, is not as strong or generalized as hypothesized earlier.

      The genetics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogeneous and remains only
      ill-defined. We have recently created a freely available and continuously
      updated online database (AlzGene; http://www.alzgene.org ) for which we
      collect all published genetic association studies in AD and perform
      systematic meta-analyses on all polymorphisms with sufficient genotype
      data. In this study, we tested 27 genes (ACE, BDNF, CH25H, CHRNB2, CST3,
      CTSD, DAPK1, GALP, hCG2039140, IL1B, LMNA, LOC439999, LOC651924, MAPT,
      MTHFR, MYH13, PCK1, PGBD1, PRNP, PSEN1, SORCS1, SORL1, TF, TFAM, TNK1,
      GWA_14q32.13, and GWA_7p15.2), all showing significant association with AD
      risk in the AlzGene meta-analyses, in a large collection of family-based
      samples comprised of 4,180 subjects from over 1,300 pedigrees. Overall, we
      observe significant association with risk for AD and polymorphisms in ACE,
      CHRNB2, TF, and an as yet uncharacterized locus on chromosome 7p15.2
      [rs1859849]. For all four loci, the association was observed with the same
      alleles as in the AlzGene meta-analyses. The convergence of case-control
      and family-based findings suggests that these loci currently represent the
      most promising AD gene candidates. Further fine-mapping and functional
      analyses are warranted to elucidate the potential biochemical mechanisms
      and epidemiological relevance of these genes.

      GAB2 as an Alzheimer disease susceptibility gene: follow-up of genomewide
      association results
    journal: Arch Neurol
    volume: 66
    issue: 2
    pages: 250-4
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Genomewide association (GWA) studies have recently implicated
      4 novel Alzheimer disease (AD) susceptibility loci (GAB2, GOLM1, and 2
      uncharacterized loci to date on chromosomes 9p and 15q). To our knowledge,
      these findings have not been independently replicated. OBJECTIVE: To
      assess these GWA findings in 4 large data sets of families affected by AD.
      DESIGN: Follow-up of genetic association findings in previous studies.
      SETTING: Academic research. PARTICIPANTS: More than 4000 DNA samples from
      almost 1300 families affected with AD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genetic
      association analysis testing of 4 GWA signals (rs7101429 [GAB2], rs7019241
      [GOLM1], rs10519262 [chromosome 15q], and rs9886784 [chromosome 9p]) using
      family-based methods. RESULTS: In the combined analyses, only rs7101429 in
      GAB2 yielded significant evidence of association with the same allele as
      in the original GWA study (P =.002). The results are in agreement with
      recent meta-analyses of this and other GAB2 polymorphisms suggesting
      approximately a 30% decrease in risk for AD among carriers of the minor
      alleles. None of the other 3 tested loci showed consistent evidence for
      association with AD across the investigated data sets. CONCLUSIONS: GAB2
      contains genetic variants that may lead to a modest change in the risk for
      AD. Despite these promising results, more data from independent samples
      are needed to better evaluate the potential contribution of GAB2 to AD
      risk in the general population.

      Hippocampal atrophy as a quantitative trait in a genome-wide association
      study identifying novel susceptibility genes for Alzheimer's disease
    journal: PLoS One
    volume: 4
    issue: 8
    pages: e6501
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: With the exception of APOE epsilon4 allele, the common genetic
      risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are unknown. METHODS
      AND FINDINGS: We completed a genome-wide association study on 381
      participants in the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)
      study. Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip.
      516,645 unique Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the
      analysis following quality control measures. The genotype data and raw
      genetic data are freely available for download (LONI,
      http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/). Two analyses were completed: a
      standard case-control analysis, and a novel approach using hippocampal
      atrophy measured on MRI as an objectively defined, quantitative phenotype.
      A General Linear Model was applied to identify SNPs for which there was an
      interaction between the genotype and diagnosis on the quantitative trait.
      The case-control analysis identified APOE and a new risk gene, TOMM40
      (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40), at a genome-wide
      significance level of &#60; or =10(-6) (10(-11) for a haplotype). TOMM40
      risk alleles were approximately twice as frequent in AD subjects as
      controls. The quantitative trait analysis identified 21 genes or
      chromosomal areas with at least one SNP with a p-value &#60; or =10(-6),
      which can be considered potential &#34;new&#34; candidate loci to explore
      in the etiology of sporadic AD. These candidates included EFNA5, CAND1,
      MAGI2, ARSB, and PRUNE2, genes involved in the regulation of protein
      degradation, apoptosis, neuronal loss and neurodevelopment. Thus, we
      identified common genetic variants associated with the increased risk of
      developing AD in the ADNI cohort, and present publicly available
      genome-wide data. Supportive evidence based on case-control studies and
      biological plausibility by gene annotation is provided. Currently no
      available sample with both imaging and genetic data is available for
      replication. CONCLUSIONS: Using hippocampal atrophy as a quantitative
      phenotype in a genome-wide scan, we have identified candidate risk genes
      for sporadic Alzheimer's disease that merit further investigation.

      Genome screen of late-onset Alzheimer's extended pedigrees identifies
      TRPC4AP by haplotype analysis
    journal: Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet
    volume: 150B
    issue: 1
    pages: 50-5
    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease is a complex progressive neurodegenerative disorder
      with profound cognitive decline. Multiple susceptibility genetic variants
      have been identified with equivocal replication. While rare, collections
      of extended pedigrees with multiple affected family members are invaluable
      for genome-wide screens. We have used two extended pedigrees, having 14-15
      siblings with four to five affected late-onset Alzheimer's disease
      patients in each, to identify the gene, transient receptor potential
      cation channel, subfamily C, member 4 associated protein (TRPC4AP), on
      chromosome 20q11.22, as relevant for the disease. Multiple significant
      SNPs in this gene were found with the initial genome scan (after
      Bonferroni correction). Additional SNPs were assessed in the families and
      in the controls which were also significant by haplotype analysis.
      Moreover, 36% of the patients' haplotypes in our collection of late-onset
      patients had the same haplotype. These results suggest that TRPC4AP is
      involved with the disease in these late-onset Alzheimer's families. The
      results also confirm the use of the genome-wide association study for
      identifying new genetic variants of complex diseases.

    title: The frequency of the TRPC4AP haplotype in Alzheimer's patients
    journal: Neurosci Lett
    volume: 450
    issue: 3
    pages: 344-6
    abstract: >-
      A haplotype in the gene for transient receptor potential cation channel,
      subfamily C, member 4 associated protein (TRPC4AP), has been identified in
      two extended pedigrees with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Nine of the
      SNPs in the haplotype were analyzed in our unrelated Alzheimer's patients
      and controls. The H1 haplotype was found in 36% of the patients (199
      patients) and in 26% of the controls (85 controls) (P=0.0282; OR=1.56;
      95%CI=1.05-2.32). The latent classification method of analysis showed that
      the H1 haplotype was characteristic of Alzheimer's patients, with
      ages-of-onset between 66 and 80 years. When clinical phenotypes were
      analyzed, there was a suggestion that the patients with this haplotype may
      have more behavioral changes and hallucinations. Moreover, both the latent
      classification analysis and logistic regression analysis indicated that
      there was no association of the haplotype with either APOE status or
      gender. The gene is part of a superfamily of cation channels that are
      involved with calcium entry into cells.

    title: Alpha-synuclein and familial Parkinson's disease
    journal: Mov Disord
    volume: 24
    issue: 8
    pages: 1125-31
    abstract: >-
      Whole gene duplications and triplications of alpha-synuclein (SNCA) can
      cause Parkinson's disease (PD), and variation in the promoter region
      (Rep1) and 3' region of SNCA has been reported to increase disease
      susceptibility. Within our cohort, one affected individual from each of 92
      multiplex PD families showing the greatest evidence of linkage to the
      region around SNCA was screened for dosage alterations and sequence
      changes; no dosage or non-synonymous sequence changes were found. In
      addition, 737 individuals (from 450 multiplex PD families) that met strict
      diagnostic criteria for PD and did not harbor a known causative mutation,
      as well as 359 neurologically normal controls, were genotyped for the Rep1
      polymorphism and four SNPs in the 3' region of SNCA. The four SNPs were in
      high LD (r(2) &#62; 0.95) and were analyzed as a haplotype. The effects of
      the Rep1 genotype and the 3' haplotype were evaluated using regression
      models employing only one individual per family. Cases had a 3% higher
      frequency of the Rep1 263 bp allele compared with controls (OR = 1.54;
      empirical P-value = 0.02). There was an inverse linear relationship
      between the number of 263 bp alleles and age of onset (empirical P-value =
      0.0004). The 3' haplotype was also associated with disease (OR = 1.29;
      empirical P-value = 0.01), but not age of onset (P = 0.40). These data
      suggest that dosage and sequence changes are a rare cause of PD, but
      variation in the promoter and 3' region of SNCA convey an increased risk
      for PD.

      Mutations in GBA are associated with familial Parkinson disease
      susceptibility and age at onset
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 72
    issue: 4
    pages: 310-6
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: To characterize sequence variation within the
      glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene in a select subset of our sample of patients
      with familial Parkinson disease (PD) and then to test in our full sample
      whether these sequence variants increased the risk for PD and were
      associated with an earlier onset of disease. METHODS: We performed a
      comprehensive study of all GBA exons in one patient with PD from each of
      96 PD families, selected based on the family-specific lod scores at the
      GBA locus. Identified GBA variants were subsequently screened in all 1325
      PD cases from 566 multiplex PD families and in 359 controls. RESULTS: Nine
      different GBA variants, five previously reported, were identified in 21 of
      the 96 PD cases sequenced. Screening for these variants in the full sample
      identified 161 variant carriers (12.2%) in 99 different PD families. An
      unbiased estimate of the frequency of the five previously reported GBA
      variants in the familial PD sample was 12.6% and in the control sample was
      5.3% (odds ratio 2.6; 95% confidence interval 1.5-4.4). Presence of a GBA
      variant was associated with an earlier age at onset (p = 0.0001). On
      average, those patients carrying a GBA variant had onset with PD 6.04
      years earlier than those without a GBA variant. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      suggests that GBA is a susceptibility gene for familial Parkinson disease
      (PD) and patients with GBA variants have an earlier age at onset than
      patients with PD without GBA variants.

    title: Variation in GIGYF2 is not associated with Parkinson disease
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 72
    issue: 22
    pages: 1886-92
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: A recent study reported that mutations in a gene on chromosome
      2q36-37, GIGYF2, result in Parkinson disease (PD). We have previously
      reported linkage to this chromosomal region in a sample of multiplex PD
      families, with the strongest evidence of linkage obtained using the subset
      of the sample having the strongest family history of disease and meeting
      the strictest diagnostic criteria. We have tested whether mutations in
      GIGYF2 may account for the previously observed linkage finding. METHODS:
      We sequenced the GIGYF2 coding region in 96 unrelated patients with PD
      used in our original study that contributed to the chromosome 2q36-37
      linkage signal. Subsequently, we genotyped the entire sample of 566
      multiplex PD kindreds as well as 1,447 controls to test whether variants
      in GIGYF2 are causative or increase susceptibility for PD. RESULTS: We
      detected three novel variants as well as one of the previously reported
      seven variants in a total of five multiple PD families; however, there was
      no consistent evidence that these variants segregated with PD in these
      families. We also did not find a significant increase in risk for PD among
      those inheriting variants in GIGYF2 (p = 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: We believe
      that variation in a gene other than GIGYF2 accounts for the previously
      reported linkage finding on chromosome 2q36-37.

      Genomic convergence to identify candidate genes for Alzheimer disease on
      chromosome 10
    journal: Hum Mutat
    volume: 30
    issue: 3
    pages: 463-71
    abstract: >-
      A broad region of chromosome 10 (chr10) has engendered continued interest
      in the etiology of late-onset Alzheimer Disease (LOAD) from both linkage
      and candidate gene studies. However, there is a very extensive
      heterogeneity on chr10. We converged linkage analysis and gene expression
      data using the concept of genomic convergence that suggests that genes
      showing positive results across multiple different data types are more
      likely to be involved in AD. We identified and examined 28 genes on chr10
      for association with AD in a Caucasian case-control dataset of 506 cases
      and 558 controls with substantial clinical information. The cases were all
      LOAD (minimum age at onset &#62; or = 60 years). Both single marker and
      haplotypic associations were tested in the overall dataset and 8 subsets
      defined by age, gender, ApoE and clinical status. PTPLA showed allelic,
      genotypic and haplotypic association in the overall dataset. SORCS1 was
      significant in the overall data sets (p=0.0025) and most significant in
      the female subset (allelic association p=0.00002, a 3-locus haplotype had
      p=0.0005). Odds Ratio of SORCS1 in the female subset was 1.7
      (p&#60;0.0001). SORCS1 is an interesting candidate gene involved in the
      Abeta pathway. Therefore, genetic variations in PTPLA and SORCS1 may be
      associated and have modest effect to the risk of AD by affecting Abeta
      pathway. The replication of the effect of these genes in different study
      populations and search for susceptible variants and functional studies of
      these genes are necessary to get a better understanding of the roles of
      the genes in Alzheimer disease.

      TDP-43 has been identified as the pathological protein in the majority of
      cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS). TARDBP mutations have so far been uniquely associated
      with familial and sporadic ALS. We describe clinicopathological and
      genetic findings in a carrier of the novel K263E TARDBP variation, who
      developed frontotemporal dementia, supranuclear palsy, and chorea, but no
      signs of motor neuron disease. Neuropathologic examination revealed
      neuronal and glial TDP-43-immunoreactive deposits, predominantly in
      subcortical nuclei and brainstem. This is the first report of a TARDBP
      variation associated with a neurodegenerative syndrome other than ALS.

      Potential late-onset Alzheimer's disease-associated mutations in the
      ADAM10 gene attenuate α-secretase activity
    journal: Human Molecular Genetics
    volume: 18
    issue: 20
    pages: 3987-3996
    abstract: >-
      ADAM10, a member of a disintegrin and metalloprotease family, is an
      α-secretase capable of anti-amyloidogenic proteolysis of the amyloid
      precursor protein. Here, we present evidence for genetic association of
      ADAM10 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as two rare potentially
      disease-associated non-synonymous mutations, Q170H and R181G, in the
      ADAM10 prodomain. These mutations were found in 11 of 16 affected
      individuals (average onset age 69.5 years) from seven late-onset AD
      families. Each mutation was also found in one unaffected subject implying
      incomplete penetrance. Functionally, both mutations significantly
      attenuated α-secretase activity of ADAM10 (&#62;70% decrease), and
      elevated Aβ levels (1.5–3.5-fold) in cell-based studies. In summary, we
      provide the first evidence of ADAM10 as a candidate AD susceptibility
      gene, and report two potentially pathogenic mutations with incomplete
      penetrance for late-onset familial AD.

      By analyzing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in a genome-wide
      association study (313,504 SNPs, three series, 844 cases and 1,255
      controls) and evaluating the 25 SNPs with the most significant allelic
      association in four additional series (1,547 cases and 1,209 controls), we
      identified a SNP (rs5984894) on Xq21.3 in PCDH11X that is strongly
      associated with LOAD in individuals of European descent from the United
      States. Analysis of rs5984894 by multivariable logistic regression
      adjusted for sex gave global P values of 5.7 x 10(-5) in stage 1, 4.8 x
      10(-6) in stage 2 and 3.9 x 10(-12) in the combined data. Odds ratios were
      1.75 (95% CI = 1.42-2.16) for female homozygotes (P = 2.0 x 10(-7)) and
      1.26 (95% CI = 1.05-1.51) for female heterozygotes (P = 0.01) compared to
      female noncarriers. For male hemizygotes (P = 0.07) compared to male
      noncarriers, the odds ratio was 1.18 (95% CI = 0.99-1.41).

      Further analysis of previously implicated linkage regions for Alzheimer's

      BACKGROUND: Genome-wide linkage studies for Alzheimer's disease have
      implicated several chromosomal regions as potential loci for
      susceptibility genes. METHODS: In the present study, we have combined a
      selection of affected relative pairs (ARPs) from the UK and the USA
      included in a previous linkage study by Myers et al. (Am J Med Genet,
      2002), with ARPs from Sweden and Washington University. In this total
      sample collection of 397 ARPs, we have analyzed linkage to chromosomes 1,
      9, 10, 12, 19 and 21, implicated in the previous scan. RESULTS: The
      analysis revealed that linkage to chromosome 19q13 close to the APOE locus
      increased considerably as compared to the earlier scan. However, linkage
      to chromosome 10q21, which provided the strongest linkage in the previous
      scan could not be detected. CONCLUSION: The present investigation provides
      yet further evidence that 19q13 is the only chromosomal region
      consistently linked to Alzheimer's disease

      Genome-wide association study implicates a chromosome 12 risk locus for

    abstract: >-
      Only Apolipoprotein E polymorphisms have been consistently associated with
      the risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), but they represent only a
      minority of the underlying genetic effect. To identify additional LOAD
      risk loci, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 492 LOAD
      cases and 498 cognitive controls using Illumina's HumanHap550 beadchip. An
      additional 238 cases and 220 controls were used as a validation data set
      for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met genome-wide
      significance. To validate additional associated SNPs (p &#60; 0.0001) and
      nominally associated candidate genes, we imputed SNPs from our GWAS using
      a previously published LOAD GWAS(1) and the IMPUTE program. Association
      testing was performed with the Cochran-Armitage trend test and logistic
      regression, and genome-wide significance was determined with the False
      Discovery Rate-Beta Uniform Mixture method. Extensive quality-control
      methods were performed at both the sample and the SNP level. The GWAS
      confirmed the known APOE association and identified association with a
      12q13 locus at genome-wide significance; the 12q13 locus was confirmed in
      our validation data set. Four additional highly associated signals (1q42,
      4q28, 6q14, 19q13) were replicated with the use of the imputed data set,
      and six candidate genes had SNPs with nominal association in both the GWAS
      and the joint imputated data set. These results help to further define the
      genetic architecture of LOAD.

      The tauopathy associated with mutation +3 in intron 10 of Tau:
      characterization of the MSTD family
    journal: Brain
    volume: 131
    issue: Pt 1
    pages: 72-89
    abstract: >-
      Multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia (MSTD) is an inherited
      disease caused by a (g) to (a) transition at position +3 in intron 10 of
      Tau. It belongs to the spectrum of frontotemporal dementia and
      parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 with mutations in Tau (FTDP-17T).
      Here we present the longitudinal clinical, neuropsychological,
      neuroimaging, neuropathological, biochemical and genetic characterization
      of the MSTD family. Presenting signs were consistent with the behavioural
      variant of frontotemporal dementia in 17 of 21 patients. Two individuals
      presented with an atypical form of progressive supranuclear palsy and two
      others with either severe postural imbalance or an isolated short-term
      memory deficit. Memory impairment was present at the onset in 15 patients,
      with word finding difficulties and stereotyped speech also being common.
      Parkinsonism was first noted 3 years after the onset of symptoms.
      Neuroimaging showed the most extensive grey matter loss in the
      hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and frontal operculum/insular cortex of
      the right hemisphere and, to a lesser extent, in the anterior cingulate
      gyrus, head of the caudate nucleus and the posterolateral orbitofrontal
      cortex and insular cortex bilaterally. Neuropathologically, progressive
      nerve cell loss, gliosis and coexistent neuronal and/or glial deposits
      consisting mostly of 4-repeat tau were present in frontal, cingulate,
      temporal and insular cortices, white matter, hippocampus, parahippocampus,
      basal ganglia, selected brainstem nuclei and spinal cord. Tau haplotyping
      indicated that specific haplotypes of the wild-type allele may act as
      modifiers of disease presentation. Quantitative neuroimaging has been used
      to analyse the progression of atrophy in affected individuals and for
      predicting disease onset in an asymptomatic mutation carrier. This
      multidisciplinary study provides a comprehensive description of the
      natural history of disease in one of the largest known families with
      FTDP-17T

      Hemoglobin binding to A beta and HBG2 SNP association suggest a role in
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Neurobiol.Aging
    volume: 29
    issue: 2
    pages: 185-193
    abstract: >-
      From a normal human brain phage display library screen we identified the
      gamma (A)-globin chain of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) as a protein that bound
      strongly to A beta1-42. We showed the oxidized form of adult Hb (metHb A)
      binds with greater affinity to A beta1-42 than metHb F. MetHb is more
      toxic than oxyhemoglobin because it loses its heme group more readily.
      Free Hb and heme readily damage vascular endothelial cells similar to
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) vascular pathology. The XmnI polymorphism
      (C--&#62;T) at -158 of the gamma (G)-globin promoter region can contribute
      to increased Hb F expression. Using family-based association testing, we
      found a significant protective association of this polymorphism in the
      NIMH sibling dataset (n=489) in families, with at least two affected and
      one unaffected sibling (p=0.006), with an age of onset &#62;50 years
      (p=0.010) and &#62;65 years (p=0.013), and families not homozygous for the
      APOE4 allele (p=0.041). We hypothesize that Hb F may be less toxic than
      adult Hb in its interaction with A beta and may protect against the
      development of AD

      OBJECTIVE: To identify putative genetic loci related to the risk of
      late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). DESIGN: Linkage analysis and
      family-based and case-control association analyses from a genomewide scan
      using approximately 6000 single-nucleotide polymorphic markers at an
      average intermarker distance of 0.65 cM. SETTING: The National Institute
      on Aging Genetics Initiative for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (NIA-AD
      FBS) was created to expand the resources for studies to identify
      additional genes contributing to the risk for LOAD. PARTICIPANTS: We
      investigated 1902 individuals from 328 families with LOAD and 236
      unrelated control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical diagnosis of
      LOAD. RESULTS: The strongest overall finding was at chromosome 19q13.32,
      confirming the effect of the apolipoprotein E gene on LOAD risk in the
      family-based and case-control analyses. However, single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms at the following loci were also statistically significant in
      1 or more of the analyses performed: 7p22.2, 7p21.3, and 16q21 in the
      linkage analyses; 17q21.31 and 22q11.21 in the family-based association
      analysis; and 7q31.1 and 22q12.3 in the case-control analysis. Positive
      associations at 7q31.1 and 20q13.33 were also significant in the
      meta-analysis results in a publicly available database. CONCLUSIONS:
      Several additional loci may harbor genetic variants associated with LOAD.
      This data set provides a wealth of phenotypic and genotypic information
      for use as a resource in discovery and confirmatory research

      Point mutations and copy number variations in SNCA, the gene encoding
      alpha-synuclein, cause familial Parkinson's disease (PD). A dinucleotide
      polymorphism (REP1) in the SNCA promoter may be a risk factor for common
      forms of PD. We studied 1,802 PD patients and 2,129 controls from the
      NeuroGenetics Research Consortium, using uniform, standardized protocols
      for diagnosis, subject recruitment, data collection, genotyping, and data
      analysis. Three common REP1 alleles (257, 259, and 261 bp, with control
      frequencies of 0.28, 0.65, and 0.06) and several rare alleles (combined
      frequency &#60;0.01) were detected. We confirmed association of REP1 with
      PD risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, P = 0.006 for 257-carriers; OR = 1.25, P
      = 0.022 for 261-carriers]. Using a normalization procedure, we showed that
      the 257 and 261 alleles are both independently associated with PD risk
      (for 257, P = 0.002 in overall data, 0.003 in non-familial PD, 0.001 in
      early-onset PD; for 261, P = 0.056 in overall data, 0.024 in non-familial
      PD, 0.052 in early-onset PD). The 257-associated risk was consistent with
      a dominant model [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.99, P = 0.91 for 257/257 vs. 257/X
      where X denotes all other common alleles; HR = 1.16, P = 0.004 for X/X vs.
      257/X]. The 261-associated risk was consistent with a recessive model (HR
      = 1.89, P = 0.026 for 261/261 vs. 261/X; HR = 0.95, P = 0.42 for X/X vs.
      261/X). Genotype-specific mean onset ages (+/-SD) ranged from 54.8 +/-
      12.1 for 261/261 to 59.4 +/- 11.5 for 257/257, displaying a trend of
      decreasing onset age with increasing allele size (P = 0.055). Genetic
      variation in SNCA and its regulatory regions play an important role in
      both familial and sporadic PD

      A luteinizing hormone receptor intronic variant is significantly
      associated with decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease in males carrying an
      apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele

      Genetic and biochemical studies support the apolipoprotein E (APOE)
      epsilon4 allele as a major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease
      (AD), though ~50% of AD patients do not carry the allele. APOE transports
      cholesterol for luteinizing hormone (LH)-regulated steroidogenesis, and
      both LH and neurosteroids have been implicated in the etiology of AD.
      Since polymorphisms of LH beta-subunit (LHB) and its receptor (LHCGR) have
      not been tested for their association with AD, we scored AD and
      age-matched control samples for APOE genotype and 14 polymorphisms of LHB
      and LHCGR. Thirteen gene-gene interactions between the loci of LHB, LHCGR,
      and APOE were associated with AD. The most strongly supported of these
      interactions was between an LHCGR intronic polymorphism (rs4073366;
      lhcgr2) and APOE in males, which was detected using all three interaction
      analyses: linkage disequilibrium, multi-dimensionality reduction, and
      logistic regression. While the APOE epsilon4 allele carried significant
      risk of AD in males [p = 0.007, odds ratio (OR) = 3.08(95%confidence
      interval: 1.37, 6.91)], epsilon4-positive males carrying 1 or 2 C-alleles
      at lhcgr2 exhibited significantly decreased risk of AD [OR = 0.06(0.01,
      0.38); p = 0.003]. This suggests that the lhcgr2 C-allele or a closely
      linked locus greatly reduces the risk of AD in males carrying an APOE
      epsilon4 allele. The reversal of risk embodied in this interaction
      powerfully supports the importance of considering the role gene-gene
      interactions play in the etiology of complex biological diseases and
      demonstrates the importance of using multiple analytic methods to detect
      well-supported gene-gene interactions

      Peripheral blood is a readily available tissue source allowing relatively
      noninvasive screening for a host of medical conditions. We screened
      total-blood progranulin (PGRN) levels in 107 patients with
      neurodegenerative dementias and related conditions, and 36 control
      subjects, and report the following findings: (1) confirmation of high
      progranulin expression levels in peripheral blood; (2) two subjects with
      reduced progranulin levels and mutations in the PGRN gene confirmed by
      direct sequencing; and (3) greater PGRN messenger RNA levels in patients
      with clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This proof-of-principle
      report supports the use of gene quantification as diagnostic screen for
      PGRN mutations and suggests a potential role for progranulin in
      Alzheimer's disease

      We have studied the impact of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) on the
      chromosome 19 linkage peak from an analysis of sib-pairs affected by
      Alzheimer's disease. We genotyped 417 affected sib-pairs (ASPs) collected
      in Sweden and Norway (SWE), the UK and the USA for 10 microsatellite
      markers on chromosome 19. The highest Zlr (3.28, chromosome-wide P-value
      0.036) from the multipoint linkage analysis was located approximately 1 Mb
      from APOE, at marker D19S178. The linkage to chromosome 19 was well
      explained by APOE in the whole sample as well as in the UK and USA
      subsamples, as identity by descent (IBD) increased with the number of
      epsilon4 alleles in ASPs. There was a suggestion from the SWE subsample
      that linkage was higher than would be expected from APOE alone, although
      the test for this did not reach formal statistical significance. There was
      also a significant age at onset (aao) effect on linkage to chromosome
      19q13 in the whole sample, which manifested itself as increased IBD
      sharing in relative pairs with lower mean aao. This effect was partially,
      although not completely, explained by APOE. The aao effect varied
      considerably between the different subsamples, with most of the effect
      coming from the UK sample. The other samples showed smaller effects in the
      same direction, but these were not significant

      Genome-wide association analysis reveals putative Alzheimer's disease
      susceptibility loci in addition to APOE

    issue: 5

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically complex and heterogeneous
      disorder. To date four genes have been established to either cause
      early-onset autosomal-dominant AD (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2(1-4)) or to
      increase susceptibility for late-onset AD (APOE5). However, the
      heritability of late-onset AD is as high as 80%, (6) and much of the
      phenotypic variance remains unexplained to date. We performed a
      genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using 484,522 single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) on a large (1,376 samples from 410 families) sample
      of AD families of self-reported European descent. We identified five SNPs
      showing either significant or marginally significant genome-wide
      association with a multivariate phenotype combining affection status and
      onset age. One of these signals (p = 5.7 x 10(-14)) was elicited by SNP
      rs4420638 and probably reflects APOE-epsilon4, which maps 11 kb proximal
      (r2 = 0.78). The other four signals were tested in three additional
      independent AD family samples composed of nearly 2700 individuals from
      almost 900 families. Two of these SNPs showed significant association in
      the replication samples (combined p values 0.007 and 0.00002). The SNP
      (rs11159647, on chromosome 14q31) with the strongest association signal
      also showed evidence of association with the same allele in GWA data
      generated in an independent sample of approximately 1,400 AD cases and
      controls (p = 0.04). Although the precise identity of the underlying
      locus(i) remains elusive, our study provides compelling evidence for the
      existence of at least one previously undescribed AD gene that, like
      APOE-epsilon4, primarily acts as a modifier of onset age

      Candidate gene discovery procedure after follow-up confirmatory analyses
      of candidate regions of interests for Alzheimer's disease in the NIMH
      sibling dataset

    pages: 293-309
    abstract: >-
      The objective of this research was to develop a procedure to identify
      candidate genes under linkage peaks confirmed in a follow-up of candidate
      regions of interests (CRIs) identified in our original genome scan in the
      NIMH Alzheimer's diseases (AD) Initiative families (Blacker et al. [1]).
      There were six CRIs identified that met the threshold of multipoint lod
      score (MLS) of &#62;or= 2.0 from the original scan. The most significant
      peak (MLS = 7.7) was at 19q13, which was attributed to APOE. The remaining
      CRIs with 'suggestive' evidence for linkage were identified at 9q22, 6q27,
      14q22, 11q25, and 3p26. We have followed up and narrowed the 9q22 CRI
      signal using simple tandem repeat (STR) markers (Perry et al. [2]). In
      this confirmatory project, we have followed up the 6q27, 14q22, 11q25, and
      3p26 CRIs with a total of 24 additional flanking STRs, reducing the mean
      interval marker distance (MID) in each CRI, and substantially increase in
      the information content (IC). The linkage signals at 6q27, 14q22 and 11q25
      remain 'suggestive', indicating that these CRIs are promising and worthy
      of detailed fine mapping and assessment of candidate genes associated with
      AD. We have developed a bioinformatics approach for identifying candidate
      genes in these confirmed regions based on the Gene Ontology terms that are
      annotated and enriched among the systematic meta-analyzed genes, confirmed
      by at least three case-control samples, and cataloged in the &#34;AlzGene
      database&#34; as potential Alzheimer disease susceptibility genes

      Comprehensive analysis of APOE and selected proximate markers for

    abstract: >-
      The epsilon(4) allele of APOE confers a two- to fourfold increased risk
      for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but LOAD pathology does not all
      fit neatly around APOE. It is conceivable that genetic variation proximate
      to APOE contributes to LOAD risk. Therefore, we investigated the degree of
      linkage disequilibrium (LD) for a comprehensive set of 50 SNPs in and
      surrounding APOE using a substantial Caucasian sample of 1100 chromosomes.
      SNPs in APOE were further molecularly haplotyped to determine their
      phases. One set of SNPs in TOMM40, roughly 15 kb upstream of APOE, showed
      intriguing LD with the epsilon(4) allele and was strongly associated with
      the risk for developing LOAD. However, when all the SNPs were entered into
      a logit model, only the effect of APOE epsilon(4) remained significant.
      These observations diminish the possibility that loci in the TOMM40 gene
      may have a major effect on the risk for LOAD in Caucasians

      A polymorphism in SOD2 is associated with development of Alzheimer's

    pages: 770-775
    abstract: >-
      Genes involved in cellular mechanisms to repair oxidative damage are
      strong candidates as etiologic factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). One
      important enzyme involved in this mechanism is superoxide dismutase 2
      (SOD2). The gene for this enzyme lies within a single haplotype block at
      6q25.3, a region showing evidence for linkage to AD in a genome scan. We
      genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SOD2 in families
      of the National Institute of Mental Health-AD Genetics Initiative (ADGI):
      rs2758346 in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), rs4880 in exon 2, rs2855116
      in intron 3 and rs5746136 in the 3'UTR. Under a dominant model,
      family-based association tests showed significant evidence for association
      of AD with the first three loci in a candidate gene set of families with
      individuals having age of onset of at least 50 years and two affected and
      one unaffected sibling, and in a late-onset subset of families (families
      with all affected individuals having age of onset of at least 65 years)
      from the full ADGI sample. The alleles transmitted more frequently to
      cases than expected under the null hypothesis were T, C, G, and G. Global
      tests of the transmission of haplotypes indicate that the first two loci
      have the most consistent association with risk of AD. Because of the high
      linkage disequilibrium in this small (14 kb) gene, and the presence of 100
      SNPs in this gene, 26 of which may have functional significance,
      additional genotyping and sequencing are needed to identify the
      functionally relevant SNP. We discuss the importance of our findings and
      the relevance of SOD2 to AD risk

      Accounting for linkage disequilibrium among markers in linkage analysis:
      impact of haplotype frequency estimation and molecular haplotypes for a
      gene in a candidate region for Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Hum.Hered.
    volume: 63
    issue: 1

    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVES: Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between closely spaced SNPs can be
      accommodated in linkage analysis by specifying the multi-SNP haplotype
      frequencies, if known. Phased haplotypes in candidate regions can provide
      gold standard haplotype frequency estimates, and may be of inherent
      interest as markers. We evaluated the effects of different methods of
      haplotype frequency estimation, and the use of marker phase information,
      on linkage analysis of a multi-SNP cluster in a candidate region for
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We performed parametric linkage
      analysis of a five-SNP cluster in extended pedigrees to compare the use
      of: (1) haplotype frequencies estimated by molecular phase determination,
      maximum likelihood estimation, or by assuming linkage equilibrium (LE);
      (2) AD families or controls as the frequency source; and (3) unphased or
      molecularly phased SNP data. RESULTS: There was moderate to strong
      pairwise LD among the five SNPs. Falsely assuming LE substantially
      inflated the LOD score, but the method of haplotype frequency estimation
      and particular sample used made little difference provided that LD was
      accommodated. Use of phased haplotypes produced a modest increase in the
      LOD score over unphased SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: Ignoring LD between markers can
      lead to substantially inflated evidence for linkage in LOD score analysis
      of extended pedigrees with missing data. Use of marker phase information
      in linkage analysis may be important in disease studies where the costs of
      family recruitment and phenotyping greatly exceed the costs of phase
      determination

      Follow-up mapping supports the evidence for linkage in the candidate

    abstract: >-
      Other than the APOE peak at 19q13, the 9q22 region was identified in our
      original genomic scan as the candidate region with the highest multipoint
      lod score (MLS) in the subset of late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
      families (MLS = 2.9 at 101 cM) from the NIMH Genetics Initiative sample.
      We have now genotyped an additional 12 short tandem repeats (STR) in this
      region. Multipoint analysis shows the region remains significant with an
      increase in the peak MLS from 2.9 to 3.8 at 95 cM near marker D9S1815, and
      the 1 LOD interval narrows from 21.5 to 11 cM. HLOD scores also provide
      evidence for significant linkage (4.5 with an alpha = 31%) with a further
      narrowing of the region to 6.6 cM (92.2-98.8 cM). Single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Ubiquilin1 gene (UBQLN1), located at 83.3 cM,
      have been reported to be significantly associated to AD, accounting for a
      substantial portion of the original linkage signal [Bertram et al., 2005].
      Our analyses of the higher resolution genotype data generated here provide
      further support for the existence of a least one additional locus on
      chromosome 9q22. In an effort to pinpoint this putative AD susceptibility
      gene, we have begun to analyze SNPs in other candidate genes in and around
      this narrowed region to test for additional associations to AD

      R1514Q substitution in Lrrk2 is not a pathogenic Parkinson's disease
      mutation
    journal: Mov Disord
    volume: 22
    issue: 2
    pages: 254-7
    abstract: >-
      Mutations in LRRK2 were first reported as causing Parkinson's disease (PD)
      in late 2004. Since then, approximately a dozen LRRK2 substitutions have
      been identified that are believed to be pathogenic mutations. The
      substitution of adenine for guanine at nucleotide 4541 (4541G&#62;A) in
      LRRK2 was recently reported. This substitution resulted in the replacement
      of an arginine at position 1514 with a glutamine (R1514Q). Although this
      substitution was not found in a large cohort of controls, its
      pathogenicity could not be verified. We have now genotyped the R1514Q
      substitution in a sample of 954 PD patients from 429 multiplex PD
      families. This substitution was identified in 1.8% of the PD patients;
      however, the majority of the PD sibships segregating this substitution
      were discordant for this putative mutation. In addition, the R1514Q
      substitution was detected in 1.4% of neurologically evaluated, control
      individuals. These data suggest that the R1514Q variant is not a
      pathogenic LRRK2 mutation. We believe it is imperative that the causative
      nature of any newly identified genetic variant be determined before it is
      included in any panel for diagnostic testing.

      LRRK2 mutation analysis in Parkinson disease families with evidence of
      linkage to PARK8
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 69
    issue: 18
    pages: 1737-44
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Pathogenic mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene
      (LRRK2) have been found to cause typical, later-onset Parkinson disease
      (PD). Although G2019S is the most common mutation, other mutations have
      also been reported. It is critical to catalog the types of mutations found
      in LRRK2 that can cause PD, so as to provide insight regarding disease
      susceptibility and potential novel treatments. METHODS: We performed a
      comprehensive study of all 51 exons of the LRRK2 gene in one PD patient
      from each of 88 multiplex PD families who had the highest family-specific
      multipoint lod score at the LRRK2 locus from a cohort of 430 PD families
      without the G2019S mutation. RESULTS: Five families (5.7%) harbored what
      seem to be novel, pathogenic mutations (L1795F, I1192V, E10K, E334K,
      Q1111H). Three of these apparent mutations were in known, functional
      domains of the LRRK2 protein, where other studies have also identified
      disease producing mutations. However, two of the novel variants were found
      in the N-terminal region of LRRK2, where no pathogenic substitutions have
      yet been reported. Similar to previous studies, all subjects with an LRRK2
      mutation had classic symptoms of PD and typical, later age at onset.
      CONCLUSIONS: We have identified five novel variants in LRRK2, with two of
      these in the N-terminal region of LRRK2, where no pathogenic substitutions
      have been previously reported. If confirmed to be causative, these
      mutations would broaden the potential mechanisms whereby mutations in
      LRRK2 result in Parkinson disease.

      Association analysis of genetic polymorphisms in the CDC2 gene with
      late-onset Alzheimer disease
    journal: Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord
    volume: 23
    issue: 2
    pages: 126-32
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder
      resulting from multiple genetic and non-genetic factors. Linkage studies
      indicated that chromosome 10 has at least one locus for this disease. The
      cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) gene, which is close to one of the linkage
      regions, has previously been associated with the risk of AD with an odds
      ratio of 1.78. Biologically, CDC2, which is involved in paired helical
      filament-tau formation, is thought as a candidate gene in AD. METHODS: In
      this study, six single nucleotide polymorphisms spanning the entire gene
      were selected and examined for association for late-onset AD (LOAD) in two
      large independent datasets. A family-based dataset including 1,337
      Caucasian discordant sib pairs and an independent dataset of 745 Caucasian
      cases and 998 controls for LOAD were used. Family-based association tests
      and logistic regression conditional on the apolipoprotein E genotype and
      sex were applied to association study in family-based and case-control
      datasets, respectively. RESULTS: Neither dataset demonstrated any
      association with LOAD in our samples with all p values &#62;0.16.
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that if any contribution of common genetic
      variants in CDC2 to the risk of developing AD exists, it is likely to be
      very small.

      Effect of heterogeneity on the chromosome 10 risk in late-onset Alzheimer
      disease
    journal: Hum Mutat
    volume: 28
    issue: 11
    pages: 1065-73
    abstract: >-
      With the exception of ApoE (APOE), no universally accepted genetic
      association has been identified with late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). A
      broad region of chromosome 10 has engendered continued interest generated
      from both preliminary genetic linkage and candidate gene studies. To
      better examine this region, we combined unbiased genetic linkage with
      candidate gene association studies. We genotyped 36 SNPs evenly spaced
      across 80.2 Mb in a family-based data set containing 1,337 discordant
      sibling pairs in 567 multiplex families to narrow the peak region of
      linkage using both covariate and subset analyses. Simultaneously, we
      examined five functional candidate genes (VR22, LRRTM3, PLAU, TNFRSF6, and
      IDE) that also fell within the broad area of linkage. A total of 50 SNPs
      were genotyped across the genes in the family-based data set and an
      independent case-control data set containing 483 cases and 879 controls.
      Of the 50 SNPs in the five candidate genes, 22 gave nominally significant
      association results in at least one data set, with at least one positive
      SNP in each gene. SNPs rs2441718 and rs2456737 in VR22 (67.8 Mb) showed
      association in both family-based and case-control data sets (both P=0.03).
      A two-point logarithmic odds (LOD) score of 2.69 was obtained at SNP
      rs1890739 (45.1 Mb, P=0.03 in 21% of the families) when the families were
      ordered from low to high by ApoE LOD score using ordered subset analysis
      (OSA). These data continue to support a role for chromosome 10 loci in AD.
      However, the candidate gene and linkage analysis results did not converge,
      suggesting that there is more extensive heterogeneity on chromosome 10
      than previously appreciated.

      Heterozygous parkin point mutations are as common in control subjects as
      in Parkinson's patients
    journal: Ann.Neurol.
    volume: 61
    issue: 1
    pages: 47-54
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: Homozygous or compound heterozygous parkin mutations cause
      juvenile parkinsonism. Heterozygous parkin mutations are also found in
      patients with typical Parkinson's disease (PD), but it is unclear whether
      a single &#34;mutation&#34; in a patient is related to disease or is
      coincidental, because the mutation frequency in control subjects is
      unknown. We present a comprehensive sequence analysis of parkin in control
      subjects. METHODS: A total of 302 patients and 301 control subjects were
      sequenced, and findings were replicated in 1,260 additional patients and
      1,657 control subjects. RESULTS: Thirty-four variants were detected, of
      which 21 were novel; 12 were polymorphisms and 22 were rare variants.
      Patients and control subjects did not differ in the frequency, type, or
      functional location of the variants. Even P437L, a common mutation thought
      to be pathogenic, was present in unaffected control subjects.
      INTERPRETATION: parkin point mutations are not exclusive to PD. The mere
      presence of a single point mutation in a patient, in the absence of a
      second mutation, should not be taken as a cause of disease unless
      corroborated by family data and functional studies. This study does not
      support the notion that heterozygous parkin sequence variants (mutations
      or polymorphisms) are risk factors for PD. Whether heterozygous dosage
      anomalies are associated with PD remains to be determined

      Extreme cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta levels identify family with
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease presenilin 1 mutation
    journal: Ann Neurol
    volume: 61
    issue: 5
    pages: 446-53
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE: Aggregation and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain
      is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      Recent studies suggest that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta levels are
      strongly correlated with AD status and progression, and may be a
      meaningful endophenotype for AD. Mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) are
      known to cause AD and change Abeta levels. In this study, we have
      investigated DNA sequence variation in the presenilin (PSEN1) gene using
      CSF Abeta levels as an endophenotype for AD. METHODS: We sequenced the
      exons and flanking intronic regions of PSEN1 in clinically characterized
      research subjects with extreme values of CSF Abeta levels. RESULTS: This
      novel approach led directly to the identification of a disease-causing
      mutation in a family with late-onset AD. INTERPRETATION: This finding
      suggests that CSF Abeta may be a useful endophenotype for genetic studies
      of AD. Our results also suggest that PSEN1 mutations can cause AD with a
      large range in age of onset, spanning both early- and late-onset AD.

      Genetic variants in brain-derived neurotrophic factor associated with
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: J.Med.Genet.
    volume: 44
    issue: 2
    pages: e66
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is complex, with variants in multiple
      genes contributing to interactions increasing risk for the disease.
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes neuronal survival and
      modulates hippocampal-dependent memory. METHODS: We examined 11 SNPs that
      spanned the gene on chromosome 11p14 in 220 Alzheimer's patients and 128
      control spouses. RESULTS: Not all of the SNPs were informative, due to
      minor allele frequencies of &#60;2%. Neither C270T nor two SNPs that
      reside proximal to exon V had significant association with the disease.
      However, we did find that the heterozygous form of the rs6265 SNP
      (Val66Met), as well as the diplotype of three SNPs (rs6265, rs11030104,
      rs2049045; H1-GTC/H2-ACG) all were highly significant in APOE 4
      non-carriers (OR = 2.734; p = 0.0096). CONCLUSION: The combination of the
      diplotypes for three SNPs exhibited significant p values for Alzheimer's
      APOE 4 non-carriers. The two SNPs (rs11030104 and rs2049045) are found
      between exons VI and VII, while the Val66Met polymorphism is located in
      the coding exon VIII; the total distance for the three SNPs is 14308 bp.
      Whether the SNPs are involved with alternative splicing of the VII/VIII
      transcript is of considerable interest

      Genome-wide linkage analysis of 723 affected relative pairs with
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease

    volume: 16
    issue: 22
    pages: 2703-2712
    abstract: >-
      Previous attempts to identify genetic loci conferring risk for late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) through linkage analysis have observed some
      regions of linkage in common. However, due to the sometimes-considerable
      overlap between the samples, some of these reports cannot be considered to
      be independent replications. In order to assess the strength of the
      evidence for linkage and to obtain the best indication of the location of
      susceptibility genes, we have amalgamated three large samples to give a
      total of 723 affected relative pairs (ARPs). Multipoint, model-free ARP
      linkage analysis was performed. Genome-wide significant evidence for
      linkage was observed on 10q21.2 (LOD=3.3) and genome-wide suggestive
      evidence was observed on 9q22.33 (LOD=2.5) and 19q13.32 (LOD=2.0). One
      further region on 9p21.3 was identified with an LOD score&#62;1. We
      observe no evidence to suggest that more than one locus is responsible for
      the linkage to 10q21.2, although this linked region may harbour more than
      one susceptibility gene. Evidence of allele-sharing heterogeneity between
      the original collection sites was observed on chromosome 9 but not on
      chromosome 10 or 19. Evidence for an interaction was observed between loci
      on chromosomes 10 and 19. Where samples overlapped, the genotyping
      consistency was high, estimated to average at 97.3%. Our large-scale
      linkage analysis consolidates clear evidence for a susceptibility locus
      for LOAD on 10q21.2

      Common genetic variation within the low-density lipoprotein
      receptor-related protein 6 and late-onset Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A
    volume: 104
    issue: 22
    pages: 9434-9439
    abstract: >-
      Genome-wide linkage studies have defined a broad susceptibility region for
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease on chromosome 12, which contains the
      Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 6 (LRP6) gene, a
      coreceptor for Wnt signaling. Here, we report the association between
      common LRP6 variants and late-onset Alzheimer's disease in a multicenter
      case-control series as well as in a large family-based series ascertained
      by the National Institute of Mental Health-National Institute on Aging
      Genetics Initiative. As shown in the genome-wide linkage studies, our
      association depends mainly on apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 (APOE-epsilon4)
      carrier status. Haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      with a set of seven allelic variants of LRP6 identified a putative risk
      haplotype, which includes a highly conserved coding sequence SNP: Ile-1062
      --&#62; Val. Functional analyses revealed that the associated allele
      Val-1062, an allele previously linked to low bone mass, has decreased
      beta-catenin signaling in HEK293T cells. Our study unveils a genetic
      relationship between LRP6 and APOE and supports the hypothesis that
      altered Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may be involved in this
      neurodegenerative disease

      DBH is a candidate gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contains a

      to modify PD susceptibility. We examined -1021C--&#62;T in a sample of
      1,244 PD patients and 1,186 unrelated control subjects. There was no
      significant difference in allele (p = 0.14) or genotype (p = 0.26)
      frequencies between the two groups. A similar result was obtained after
      pooling our data with those previously published. Furthermore, we found no

      Testing for linkage and association across the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase
      gene region with Alzheimer's disease in three sample populations
    journal: Neurochem.Res.
    volume: 32
    issue: 42099
    pages: 857-869
    abstract: >-
      Prior case-control studies from our laboratory of a population enriched
      with individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent suggested that association
      exists between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the chromosomal region near
      the DLD gene, which encodes the mitochondrial dihydrolipoamide
      dehydrogenase enzyme. In support of this finding, we found that linkage
      analysis restricted to autopsy-proven patients in the National Institute
      of Mental Health-National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease
      (NIMH-NCRAD) Genetics Initiative pedigree data resulted in point-wise
      significant evidence for linkage (minimum p-value = 0.024) for a marker
      position close to the DLD locus. We now report case-control replication
      studies in two independent Caucasian series from the US and Italy, as well
      as a linkage analysis from the NIMH-NCRAD Genetics Initiative Database.
      Pair-wise analysis of the SNPs in the case-control series indicated there
      was strong linkage disequilibrium across the DLD locus in these
      populations, as previously reported. These findings suggest that testing
      for association of complex diseases with DLD locus should have
      considerable statistical power. Analysis of multi-locus genotypes or
      haplotypes based upon three SNP loci combined with results from our
      previous report provided trends toward significant evidence of association
      of DLD with AD, although neither of the present studies' association
      showed significance at the 0.05 level. Combining linkage and association
      findings for all AD patients (males and females) results in a p-value that
      is more significant than any of the individual findings' p-values.
      Finally, minimum sample size calculations using parameters from the DLD
      locus suggest that sample sizes on the order of 1,000 total cases and
      controls are needed to detect association for a wide range of genetic
      model parameters

      Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene result in
      typical late-onset Parkinson disease (PD).1,2 Yet the neuropathological
      heterogeneity observed in such patients (eg, nigral degeneration alone or
      in combination with tau pathology, diffuse Lewy bodies, brainstem Lewy
      bodies, or anterior horn cell loss) suggests that LRRK2 might be involved
      in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases.1,2 The
      potential role of LRRK2 in Alzheimer disease (AD) is of particular
      interest because the gene resides within a region on chromosome 12
      previously linked to late-onset AD.3 The aim of this study was to screen a
      large sample of patients with AD for the presence of the LRRK2 mutation
      most common in PD

    abstract: >-
      Mutations in DJ-1 (PARK7) are one cause of early-onset autosomal-recessive
      parkinsonism. We screened for DJ-1 mutations in 93 affected individuals
      from the 64 multiplex Parkinson disease (PD) families in our sample that
      had the highest family-specific multipoint LOD scores at the DJ-1 locus.
      In addition to sequencing all coding exons for alterations, we used
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to examine the
      genomic copy number of DJ-1 exons. A known polymorphism (R98Q) was found
      in five PD subjects, once as a homozygote and in the other four cases as
      heterozygotes. No additional missense mutations and no exon deletions or
      duplications were detected. Our results, in combination with those of
      previous studies, suggest that alterations in DJ-1 are not a common cause
      of familial PD

      Nine families with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD), all of
      whom had the Ala431Glu substitution in the PSEN1 gene and came from
      Jalisco State in Mexico, have been previously reported. As they shared
      highly polymorphic flanking dinucleotide marker alleles, this strongly
      suggests that this mutation arose from a common founder. In the current
      letter, we expand this observation by describing an additional 15
      independent families with the Ala431Glu substitution in the PSEN1 gene and
      conclude that this mutation is not an uncommon cause of early-onset
      autosomal dominant AD in persons of Mexican origin

      Covariate analysis of late-onset Alzheimer disease refines the chromosome
      12 locus
    journal: Mol.Psychiatry
    volume: 11
    issue: 3
    pages: 280-285
    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of
      later life with a complex etiology and a strong genetic component. Several
      genomic screens have suggested that a region between chromosome 12p13 and
      12q22 contains at least one additional locus underlying the susceptibility
      of AD. However, localization of this locus has been difficult. We
      performed a 5 cM microsatellite marker screen across 74 cM on chromosome
      12 with 15 markers in 585 multiplex families consisting of 994 affected
      sibpairs and 213 other affected relative pairs. Analyses across the entire
      data set did not reveal significant evidence of linkage. However,
      suggestive linkage was observed in several subsets. In the 91 families
      where no affected individuals carry an ApoE varepsilon4 allele, an HLOD
      score of 1.55 was generated at D12S1042. We further examined the linkage
      data considering the proposed linkages to chromosome 9 (D9S741) and
      chromosome 10 (alpha-catenin gene). There was a modest (P=0.20) increase
      in the LOD score for D12S368 (MLOD=1.70) when using the D9S741 LOD scores
      as a covariate and a highly significant (P&#60;0.001) increase in the MLOD
      score (4.19) for D12S1701 in autopsy-confirmed families (n=228) when using
      alpha-catenin LOD scores as a covariate. In both cases, families with no
      evidence of linkage to D9S741 or alpha-catenin demonstrated most of the
      evidence of linkage to chromosome 12, suggesting locus heterogeneity.
      Taken together, our data suggest that the 16 cM region between D12S1042
      and D12S368 should be the subject of further detailed genomic efforts for
      the disease

      Revealing the role of glutathione S-transferase omega in age-at-onset of
      Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases
    journal: Neurobiol.Aging
    volume: 27
    issue: 8
    pages: 1087-1093
    abstract: >-
      We previously reported a linkage region on chromosome 10q for age-at-onset
      (AAO) of Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson (PD) diseases. Glutathione
      S-transferase, omega-1 (GSTO1) and the adjacent gene GSTO2, located in
      this linkage region, were then reported to associate with AAO of AD and
      PD. To examine whether GSTO1 and GSTO2 (hereafter referred to as GSTO1h)
      are responsible for the linkage evidence, we identified 39 families in AD
      that lead to our previous linkage and association findings. The evidence
      of linkage and association was markedly diminished after removing these 39
      families from the analyses, thus providing support that GSTO1h drives the
      original linkage results. The maximum average AAO delayed by GSTO1h SNP
      7-1 (rs4825, A nucleotide) was 6.8 (+/-4.41) years for AD and 8.6(+/-5.71)
      for PD, respectively. This is comparable to the magnitude of AAO
      difference by APOE-4 in these same AD and PD families. These findings
      suggest the presence of genetic heterogeneity for GSTO1h's effect on AAO,
      and support GSTO1h's role in modifying AAO in these two disorders

      Validity and utility of a LRRK2 G2019S mutation test for the diagnosis of
      Parkinson's disease
    journal: Genet.Test.

    issue: 3
    pages: 221-227
    abstract: >-
      The G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene, the most common known cause of
      Parkinson's disease (PD), will soon be widely available as a molecular
      clinical test for PD. The objective of this study was to assess
      performance characteristics of G2019S as a clinical test for PD in the
      setting of typical movement disorder clinics in the United States.
      Subjects included 1,518 sequentially recruited PD patients from seven
      movement disorder clinics in the United States, and 1,733 unaffected
      subjects. All 3,251 subjects were genotyped for the G2019S mutation using
      a TaqMan assay, and mutations were verified by direct sequencing. Test
      validity estimates were calculated using standard methods. A total of
      20/1518 patients and 1/1733 controls carried the G2019S mutation.
      Specificity was 99.9% (95% CI, 99.6-100%), sensitivity was 1.3%
      (0.8-2.1%), and the positive likelihood ratio was 22.8. A positive family
      history of PD increased the positive likelihood ratio to 82.5. Information
      on gender, age at disease onset, or age at testing did not improve test
      performance. The gene test was highly accurate in classifying mutation
      carriers as PD, but it performed poorly in predicting the phenotype of
      non-mutation carriers. A G2019S molecular test for PD would be highly
      specific, technically simple, and inexpensive. Test interpretation is
      straightforward when used for diagnosis of symptomatic individuals, but is
      more complex for risk assessment and predictive testing in asymptomatic
      individuals. Test results can have psychological, social, and economical
      ramifications; thus, proper counseling is essential

    volume: 43
    issue: 8
    pages: e42
    abstract: >-
      Cytochrome P450 aromatase, an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of
      androgens to oestrogen, is expressed at high levels in the gonads and in
      the brain. Aromatase activity is increased in the nucleus basalis of
      Meynert during aging and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), making the gene
      (CYP19), at 15q21.1, a potential candidate risk factor. We examined 18
      single nucleotide polymorphisms spanning the 5'-untranslated region and
      the entire coding region of CYP19 in 227 patients with AD and 131 control
      spouses. We found that the gene region could be divided into two haplotype
      blocks; a haplotype in block 1 and a haplotype in block 2 increased the
      risk of developing the disease by twofold in APOE 4 carriers. The
      implication of two haplotypes conferring increased risk for AD warrants
      further investigation of the regulation of aromatase activity in brain.

      A scan of chromosome 10 identifies a novel locus showing strong
      association with late-onset Alzheimer disease
    journal: Am.J.Hum.Genet.
    volume: 78
    issue: 1
    pages: 78-88
    abstract: >-
      Strong evidence of linkage to late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) has been
      observed on chromosome 10, which implicates a wide region and at least one
      disease-susceptibility locus. Although significant associations with
      several biological candidate genes on chromosome 10 have been reported,
      these findings have not been consistently replicated, and they remain
      controversial. We performed a chromosome 10-specific association study
      with 1,412 gene-based single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to identify
      susceptibility genes for developing LOAD. The scan included SNPs in 677 of
      1,270 known or predicted genes; each gene contained one or more markers,
      about half (48%) of which represented putative functional mutations. In
      general, the initial testing was performed in a white case-control sample
      from the St. Louis area, with 419 LOAD cases and 377 age-matched controls.
      Markers that showed significant association in the exploratory analysis
      were followed up in several other white case-control sample sets to
      confirm the initial association. Of the 1,397 markers tested in the
      exploratory sample, 69 reached significance (P &#60; .05). Five of these
      markers replicated at P &#60; .05 in the validation sample sets. One
      marker, rs498055, located in a gene homologous to RPS3A (LOC439999), was
      significantly associated with Alzheimer disease in four of six
      case-control series, with an allelic P value of .0001 for a meta-analysis
      of all six samples. One of the case-control samples with significant
      association to rs498055 was derived from the linkage sample (P = .0165).
      These results indicate that variants in the RPS3A homologue are associated
      with LOAD and implicate this gene, adjacent genes, or other functional
      variants (e.g., noncoding RNAs) in the pathogenesis of this disorder

      Lack of replication of thirteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms implicated
      in Parkinson's disease: a large-scale international study
    journal: Lancet Neurol.
    volume: 5
    issue: 11
    pages: 917-923
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: A genome-wide association study identified 13
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with
      Parkinson's disease. Small-scale replication studies were largely
      non-confirmatory, but a meta-analysis that included data from the original
      study could not exclude all SNP associations, leaving relevance of several
      markers uncertain. METHODS: Investigators from three Michael J Fox
      Foundation for Parkinson's Research-funded genetics consortia-comprising
      14 teams-contributed DNA samples from 5526 patients with Parkinson's
      disease and 6682 controls, which were genotyped for the 13 SNPs. Most
      (88%) participants were of white, non-Hispanic descent. We assessed
      log-additive genetic effects using fixed and random effects models
      stratified by team and ethnic origin, and tested for heterogeneity across
      strata. A meta-analysis was undertaken that incorporated data from the
      original genome-wide study as well as subsequent replication studies.
      FINDINGS: In fixed and random-effects models no associations with any of
      the 13 SNPs were identified (odds ratios 0.89 to 1.09). Heterogeneity
      between studies and between ethnic groups was low for all SNPs. Subgroup
      analyses by age at study entry, ethnic origin, sex, and family history did
      not show any consistent associations. In our meta-analysis, no SNP showed
      significant association (summary odds ratios 0.95 to 1.08); there was
      little heterogeneity except for SNP rs7520966. INTERPRETATION: Our results
      do not lend support to the finding that the 13 SNPs reported in the
      original genome-wide association study are genetic susceptibility factors
      for Parkinson's disease

      The multiple polymorphisms contributing to Alzheimer disease (AD) have
      been difficult to identify. Three essentially sufficient risk sets were
      found using a fuzzy latent classification statistical model; that is,
      grade-of-membership analysis, and genotypes for APOE, APOCI, LDLr,
      cystatin C, and cathepsin D (180 cases, 120 controls). These were: (a)
      CST3:GA and CTSD:CT; (b) APOE44 and LDLr8:GG and LDLr13:TT; and (c) APOE34
      and LDLr13:TC. Consonance with one of the groups and high aggregate
      membership carried &#62;800-fold elevated risk for AD. The absence of
      these combinations defined low risk. APOE3/- with heterozygous promoter
      and receptor genotypes predicted long life without dementia

      Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids: clinical,
      pathologic and genetic studies of a new kindred
    journal: Acta Neuropathol.
    volume: 111
    issue: 4
    pages: 300-311
    abstract: >-
      Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) is a rare
      autosomal dominant disorder characterized by cerebral white matter
      degeneration with axonal spheroids leading to progressive cognitive and
      motor dysfunction. We report clinical and pathological features, as well
      as molecular genetic analysis, of a family with HDLS. A pedigree
      consisting of 27 persons in 5 generations contained 6 affected
      individuals. Dementia and depression were common; two individuals
      presented with a syndrome resembling corticobasal degeneration (CBD).
      Postmortem neuropathologic evaluation of three affected individuals
      revealed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and marked attenuation of
      cerebral white matter, but preservation of white matter in brainstem and
      cerebellum, except for the corticospinal tract. Histopathologic studies
      showed a loss of myelinated fibers, lipid-laden macrophages and bizarre
      astrocytes, as well as abundant axonal spheroids that were immunoreactive
      for phosphorylated neurofilament protein and amyloid precursor protein
      (APP), but not alphaB-crystallin and variably with ubiquitin. By electron
      microscopy, axonal spheroids contained aggregates of intermediate
      filaments or of organelles that were predominantly vesicular and lamellar.
      The cerebral cortex had focal neuronal degeneration with
      alphaB-crystallin-immunoreactive ballooned neurons. In summary, the
      present report describes a previously unreported kindred with HDLS with
      individuals presenting as CBD. Immunohistochemistry for APP and
      alphaB-crystallin demonstrates distinctive neurodegeneration in cerebral
      axons and perikarya

      APOE and other loci affect age-at-onset in Alzheimer's disease families
      with PS2 mutation
    journal: Am.J.Med.Genet.B Neuropsychiatr.Genet.
    volume: 132B
    issue: 1
    pages: 14-20
    abstract: >-
      Several kindreds of Volga German (VG) ancestry have a single PS2 mutation
      that causes an autosomal dominant form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These
      families show a wide range in age-at-onset, which suggests the existence
      of modifying factors other than the PS2 mutation. To examine evidence for
      a genetic basis of variation in onset age, we performed a Bayesian
      oligogenic segregation and linkage analysis on nine VG families confirmed
      to have at least one affected PS2 carrier. This analysis simultaneously
      estimated the effects of APOE and PS2 and the number and effects of
      additional loci affecting AD age-at-onset. In addition, a family effect
      accounted for shared environmental effects. This analysis approach has the
      advantage of full use of the complete pedigree structure, as well as use
      of information on unsampled individuals with phenotypic data. These
      analyses provide evidence that APOE plays a small, but significant, role
      in modifying the age-at-onset in these VG families. The effects estimated
      for the APOE epsilon3 and epsilon4 genotypes were consistent with those
      estimated in previous analysis of late-onset AD families, with evidence
      for a dose-dependent relationship between number of epsilon4 alleles and
      age-at-onset. We estimated an approximately 83% posterior probability of
      at least one modifier locus in addition to APOE, and that the fraction of
      the variance in age-at-onset attributable to PS2, APOE, other loci, and
      family effects is approximately 70, approximately 2, approximately 6.5,
      and approximately 8.5%, respectively. These results provide evidence that
      APOE and other loci modify onset in AD caused by PS2 mutation

    title: Maternal lineages and Alzheimer disease risk in the Old Order Amish
    journal: Hum.Genet.
    volume: 118
    issue: 1
    pages: 115-122
    abstract: >-
      Old Order Amish, founded by a small number of Swiss immigrants, exist in
      culturally isolated communities across rural North America. The
      consequences of genetic isolation and inbreeding within this group are
      evident by increased frequencies of many monogenic diseases and several
      complex disorders. Conversely, the prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD),
      the most common form of dementia, is lower in the Amish than in the
      general American population. Since mitochondrial dysfunction has been
      proposed as an underlying cause of AD and a specific haplogroup was found
      to affect AD susceptibility in Caucasians, we investigated whether
      inherited mitochondrial haplogroups affect risk of developing AD dementia
      in Ohio and Indiana Amish communities. Ninety-five independent matrilines
      were observed across six large pedigrees and three small pedigrees then
      classified into seven major European haplogroups. Haplogroup T is the most
      frequent haplogroup represented overall in these maternal lines (35.4%)
      while observed in only 10.6% in outbred American and European populations.
      Furthermore, haplogroups J and K are less frequent (1.0%) than in the
      outbred data set (9.4-11.2%). Affected case matrilines and unaffected
      control lines were chosen from pedigrees to test whether specific
      haplogroups and their defining SNPs confer risk of AD. We did not observe
      frequency differences between AD cases compared to controls overall or
      when stratified by sex. Therefore, we suggest that the genetic effect
      responsible for AD dementia in the affected Amish pedigrees is unlikely to
      be of mitochondrial origin and may be caused by nuclear genetic factors

      Linkage disequilibrium fine mapping and haplotype association analysis of
      the tau gene in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal

    journal: J.Med.Genet.
    volume: 42
    issue: 11
    pages: 837-846
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: The haplotype H1 of the tau gene, MAPT, is highly associated
      with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration
      (CBD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenic basis of this association.
      METHODS: Detailed linkage disequilibrium and common haplotype structure of
      MAPT were examined in 27 CEPH trios using validated HapMap genotype data
      for 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning MAPT. RESULTS:
      Multiple variants of the H1 haplotype were resolved, reflecting a far
      greater diversity of MAPT than can be explained by the H1 and H2 clades
      alone. Based on this, six haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) that capture 95%
      of the common haplotype diversity were used to genotype well characterised
      PSP and CBD case-control cohorts. In addition to strong association with
      PSP and CBD of individual SNPs, two common haplotypes derived from these
      htSNPs were identified that are highly associated with PSP: the sole H2
      derived haplotype was underrepresented and one of the common H1 derived
      haplotypes was highly associated, with a similar trend observed in CBD.
      There were powerful and highly significant associations with PSP and CBD
      of haplotypes formed by three H1 specific SNPs. This made it possible to
      define a candidate region of at least approximately 56 kb, spanning
      sequences from upstream of MAPT exon 1 to intron 9. On the H1 haplotype
      background, these could harbour the pathogenic variants. CONCLUSIONS: The
      findings support the pathological evidence that underlying variations in
      MAPT could contribute to disease pathogenesis by subtle effects on gene
      expression and/or splicing. They also form the basis for the investigation
      of the possible genetic role of MAPT in Parkinson's disease and other
      tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease

      Apolipoprotein gene E4 allele promoter polymorphisms as risk factors for
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Psychiatr Genet
    volume: 15
    issue: 4
    pages: 271-5
    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder, characterized
      by progressive cognitive decline and distinct neuropathology. The
      apolipoprotein gene E4 allele (APOE 4) is a major risk factor for the
      disease. Promoter polymorphisms at -491 and -427 may also contribute to
      the risk. We examined the two polymorphisms in 178 Alzheimer's patients
      and 141 controls. The -491AA genotype was overrepresented among the
      patients (68 versus 54%, P=0.01). However, in patients who were APOE4
      carriers, the -491AA genotype more than doubled the risk [odds ratio
      (OR)=2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.2-5.4], especially in combination
      with -427TT [odds ratio (OR)=3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.5-7.7].
      Moreover, the -491A/-427T/APOE4/APOC1A haplotype was threefold higher for
      patients. These results contribute to the evidence that regulation of
      APOE4 expression modulates risk for Alzheimer's disease.

      Association studies between risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease and
      variants in insulin degrading enzyme

    volume: 136B
    issue: 1

    abstract: >-
      Linkage studies have suggested there is a susceptibility gene for late
      onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in a broad region of chromosome 10. A
      strong positional and biological candidate is the gene encoding the
      insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a protease involved in the catabolism of
      Abeta. However, previous association studies have produced inconsistent
      results. To systematically evaluate the role of variation in IDE in the
      risk for LOAD, we genotyped 18 SNPs spanning a 276 kb region in and around
      IDE, including three &#34;tagging&#34; SNPs identified in an earlier
      study. We used four case-control series with a total of 1,217 cases and
      1,257 controls. One SNP (IDE_7) showed association in two samples (P-value
      = 0.0066, and P = 0.026, respectively), but this result was not replicated
      in the other two series. None of the other SNPs showed association with
      LOAD in any of the tested samples. Haplotypes, constructed from the three
      tagging SNPs, showed no globally significant association. In the UK2
      series, the CTA haplotype was over-represented in cases (P = 0.046), and
      in the combined data set, the CCG haplotype was more frequent in controls
      (P = 0.015). However, these weak associations observed in our series were
      in the opposite direction to the results in previous studies. Although our
      results are not universally negative, we were unable to replicate the
      results of previous studies and conclude that common variants or
      haplotypes of these variants in IDE are not major risk factors for LOAD

      Chromosome 21 BACE2 haplotype associates with Alzheimer's disease: a

    abstract: >-
      Genetic linkage studies have provided evidence for a late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility locus on chromosome 21q. We have
      tested, in a two-stage association study, whether allelic or haplotype
      variation of the beta-amyloid cleaving enzyme-2 (BACE2) locus on
      chromosome 21q affects the risk of late-onset AD. In stage-1, an
      unselected population-based sample of Finns aged 85 years or over (n=515)
      was analysed. Neuropathologic examination including beta-amyloid load
      quantification was possible in over 50% (n=264) of these subjects. AD
      patients (n=100) and controls (n=48) were defined by modified
      neuropathological NIA-RI criteria. Positive associations were taken as a
      hypothesis, and tested in stage-2 using 483 AD families from the USA. Four
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of BACE2 gene were tested in
      stage-1. A SNP close to exon-6 was associated with neuropathologically
      verified AD (p=0.02) and also with beta-amyloid load in non-selected
      autopsied subjects after conditioning with APOE genotype (p=0.001). In
      haplotype analysis a specific, relatively common haplotype (H5) was found
      to associate with AD (p=0.004) and a second haplotype (H7) showed a weaker
      association with protection against AD (p=0.04). In stage-2, the SNP
      association was not replicated, whereas the haplotype H5 association was
      replicated (p=0.004) and a trend to association was found with the
      putative protective haplotype H7 (two-sided p=0.08). BACE2 haplotype
      association with AD in two independent datasets provides further evidence
      for an AD susceptibility locus on chromosome 21q within or close to BACE2

      Interaction between the alpha-T catenin gene (VR22) and APOE in
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: J.Med.Genet.
    volume: 42
    issue: 10
    pages: 787-792
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: APOE is the only gene that has been consistently replicated as
      a risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease. Several recent studies
      have identified linkage to chromosome 10 for both risk and age of onset,
      suggesting that this region harbours genes that influence the development
      of the disease. A recent study reported association between single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VR22 gene (CTNNA3) on chromosome 10
      and plasma levels of Abeta42, an endophenotype related to Alzheimer's
      disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether polymorphisms in the VR22 gene are
      associated with Alzheimer's disease in a large sample of Alzheimer's
      disease families and an independent set of unrelated cases and controls.
      RESULTS: Several SNPs showed association in either the family based or
      case-control analyses (p&#60;0.05). The most consistent findings were with
      SNP6, for which there was significant evidence of association in both the
      families and the unrelated cases and controls. Furthermore, there was
      evidence of significant interaction between APOE-4 and two of the VR22
      SNPs, with the strongest evidence of association being concentrated in
      individuals carrying APOE-4. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that VR22 or
      a nearby gene influences susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease, and the
      effect is dependent on APOE status

      Genetic association of the APP binding protein 2 gene (APBB2) with late

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder predisposed
      by multiple genetic factors. Mutations in amyloid beta precursor protein
      (APP) are known to be associated with autosomal dominant, early onset
      familial AD and possibly also late onset AD (LOAD). A number of genes
      encoding proteins capable of binding to APP have been identified, but
      their contribution to AD pathobiology remains unclear. Conceivably,
      mutations in these genes may play a role in affecting AD susceptibility,
      which appears to be substantiated by some genetic studies. Here we report
      results of the first genetic association study with APBB2, an APP binding
      protein (also known as FE65L), and LOAD, in three independently collected
      case-control series totaling approximately 2,000 samples. Two SNPs were
      significantly associated with LOAD in two sample series and in
      meta-analyses of all three sample sets (for rs13133980: odds ratio
      [OR](hom)=1.36 [95% CI: 1.05-1.75], OR(het)=1.32 [95% CI: 1.04-1.67],
      minor allele frequency=43%, P=0.041; and for hCV1558625: OR(hom)=1.37 [95%
      CI: 1.06-1.77], OR(het)=1.02 [95% CI: 0.82-1.26], minor allele
      frequency=48%, P=0.026). One of these SNPs, located in a region conserved
      between the human and mouse genome, showed a significant interaction with
      age of disease onset. For this marker, the association with LOAD was most
      pronounced in subjects with disease onset before 75 years of age
      (OR(hom)=2.43 [95% CI: 1.61-3.67]; OR(het)=2.15 [95% CI: 1.46-3.17];
      P=0.00006) in the combined sample set. Our data raise the possibility that
      genetic variations in APBB2 may affect LOAD susceptibility

      Genome screen for loci influencing age at onset and rate of decline in

      We performed an affected sib-pair (ASP) linkage analysis to test for the
      effects of age at onset (AAO), rate of decline (ROD), and Apolipoprotein E
      (APOE) genotype on linkage to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a
      sample comprising 428 sib-pairs. We observed linkage of mean AAO to
      chromosome 21 in the whole sample (max LOD = 2.57). This came entirely
      from the NIMH sample (max LOD = 3.62), and was strongest in pairs with
      high mean AAO (&#62;80). A similar effect was observed on chromosome 2q in
      the NIMH sample (max LOD = 2.73); this region was not typed in the IADC/UK
      sample. Suggestive evidence was observed in the combined sample of linkage
      of AAO difference to chromosome 19q (max LOD = 2.33) in the vicinity of
      APOE and 12p (max LOD = 2.22), with linkage strongest in sib-pairs with
      similar AAO. Mean ROD showed suggestive evidence of linkage to chromosome
      9q in the whole sample (max LOD = 2.29), with the effect strongest in the
      NIMH sample (max LOD = 3.58), and in pairs with high mean ROD. Additional
      suggestive evidence was also observed in the NIMH sample with AAO
      difference on chromosome 6p (max LOD = 2.44) and 15p (max LOD = 1.87),
      with linkage strongest in pairs with similar AAO, and in the UK sample
      with mean ROD on chromosome 1p (max LOD = 2.73, linkage strongest in pairs
      with high mean ROD). We also observed suggestive evidence of increased
      identical by descent (IBD) in APOE epsilon4 homozygotes on chromosome 1
      (max LOD = 3.08) and chromosome 9 (max LOD = 3.34). The previously
      reported genome-wide linkage of AD to chromosome 10 was not influenced by
      any of the covariates studied

      Neuregulin-1 polymorphism in late onset Alzheimer's disease families with

    abstract: >-
      Probands with late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) exhibit positive
      symptoms of psychosis, 30-60% of the time. Positive symptoms of psychosis
      have been shown to appear prior to the onset of dementia to be accompanied
      by greater cognitive deficits, and to predict a more rapid decline. A
      study of the distribution of AD with psychosis (ADP) in families from the
      NIMH Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Initiative sample indicates that the
      trait is heritable, and linkage studies of multiplex ADP families have
      found suggestive peaks on 2p, 6q, 8p, and 21q. A genome scan of idiopathic
      psychosis, schizophrenia, in the Icelandic population identified a risk
      haplotype within the 5' region of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) on 8p12.
      Associations with NRG1 SNPs have also been found in other schizophrenia
      populations from Scotland, Ireland, and China. Here, we report results
      demonstrating a significant linkage peak for ADP on 8p12 in the NIMH AD
      dataset, encompassing the NRG1 region. We also demonstrate that there is a
      significant association with a NRG1 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism),
      rs392499, with ADP, chi2 = 7.0, P = 0.008. This same SNP is part of a
      3-SNP haplotype preferentially transmitted to individuals with this
      phenotype. Our results suggest that NRG1 plays a role in increasing the
      genetic risk to positive symptoms of psychosis in a proportion of LOAD
      families

      Substantial laboratory evidence suggests Transforming Growth Factor-beta1
      (TGFB1) is linked to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. The purpose of
      the study was to estimate the genetic association of TGFB1 with AD while
      controlling for apolipoprotein E4 allele (APOE4) status, the only
      well-established genetic risk factor for AD. Two study populations were
      genotyped for the TGFB1-509 and +869 single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) that have been associated with TGFB1 levels. Constituting these
      populations were 203 families from the NIMH AD Genetic Initiative with at
      least two affected siblings and a normal sibling, and a population of 126
      African-American (AA) AD cases versus 93 age matched controls. Results
      from family-based analyses showed a significant association between the
      TGFB1 -509 SNP and AD for the entire set of 203 families (P = 0.007), and
      a subset of these families without a homozygous APOE4 family member (P =
      0.026). Results from family-based analyses on the TGFB1 +869 SNP were not
      significant in the 203 families. While associations for the main effects
      of the TGFB1 +869 and -509 SNP with AD in the AA case-control study were
      also not significant, results did indicate that TGFB1 may function as an
      effect modifier of APOE4 risk. Specifically, the odds of AD associated
      with having at least one APOE4 allele increased in an additive fashion
      with one or two copies of the higher producer allele when stratified by
      TGFB1 -509 genotype and by TGFB1 +869 genotype. Results support a role for
      TGFB1 in AD pathogenesis

      BACKGROUND: Multiple genes have been provisionally associated with
      Alzheimer's disease, including the coding polymorphisms in exons 8 and 13
      in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene (LDLR), situated on
      chromosome 19p13.2. METHODS: The sample groups consisted of 180 AD
      patients and 141 control spouses. We carried out genotyping of LDLR8 and
      LDLR13. RESULTS: The LDLR8 GG genotype was common, found in 84% of the
      unaffected control subjects and 91% of the AD patients in our study. There
      was a ninefold elevation in risk associated with GG:CC versus A- and T-
      among APOE4+ subjects when compared with A

      Cystatin C, a protease inhibitor with widespread distribution, is

      patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). We compared frequencies for the CST
      3 exon 1 polymorphism in patients with AD and controls. A proportional
      odds model indicated that the CST 3 A and APOE4 combination carried a high
      risk: a 14-fold elevation for men and 16-fold for women. These risks apply
      to risk at ages older than 64 years and to a shift in onset to ages
      younger than 65 years

      Genes known to contribute to the genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) are active in pathways of neurodegeneration but explain only
      a minority of the genetic contribution to AD. A protein of importance in
      cerebral neurodegeneration is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor
      (BDNF). Variations in two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within
      the BDNF gene have previously been associated with AD, and one of these
      SNPs has also been associated with memory loss and affective disorders. We
      performed a case control study of three BDNF SNPs in 250
      neuropathologically confirmed cases of AD and 194 unrelated controls. We
      did not find a significant association between the three BDNF SNPs studied
      and AD when evaluated individually or with haplotype analysis. Nor did
      BDNF genotype appear to affect the APOE epsilon4 association with AD. The
      three SNPs studied were closely linked (D' = 0.99 across the region). We
      discuss possible reasons for our failure to confirm the previously
      reported associations

      Evidence for a novel late-onset Alzheimer disease locus on chromosome

    issue: 3

    abstract: >-
      Late-onset familial Alzheimer disease (LOFAD) is a genetically
      heterogeneous and complex disease for which only one locus, APOE, has been
      definitively identified. Difficulties in identifying additional loci are
      likely to stem from inadequate linkage analysis methods. Nonparametric
      methods suffer from low power because of limited use of the data, and
      traditional parametric methods suffer from limitations in the complexity
      of the genetic model that can be feasibly used in analysis. Alternative
      methods that have recently been developed include Bayesian Markov
      chain-Monte Carlo methods. These methods allow multipoint linkage analysis
      under oligogenic trait models in pedigrees of arbitrary size; at the same
      time, they allow for inclusion of covariates in the analysis. We applied
      this approach to an analysis of LOFAD on five chromosomes with previous
      reports of linkage. We identified strong evidence of a second LOFAD gene
      on chromosome 19p13.2, which is distinct from APOE on 19q. We also
      obtained weak evidence of linkage to chromosome 10 at the same location as
      a previous report of linkage but found no evidence for linkage of LOFAD
      age-at-onset loci to chromosomes 9, 12, or 21

      We examined the association of mtDNA variation with Alzheimer disease (AD)
      risk in Caucasians (989 cases and 328 controls) testing the effect of
      individual haplogroups and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
      Logistic regression analyses were used to assess risk of haplogroups and
      SNPs with AD in both main effects and interaction models. Males classified
      as haplogroup U showed an increase in risk (OR = 2.30; 95% CI, 1.03-5.11;
      P = 0.04) of AD relative to the most common haplogroup H, while females
      demonstrated a significant decrease in risk with haplogroup U (OR = 0.44 ;
      95% CI, 0.24-0.80; P = 0.007). Our results were independent of APOE
      genotype, demonstrating that the effect of mt variation is not confounded
      by APOE4 carrier status. We suggest that variations within haplogroup U
      may be involved in AD expression in combination with environmental
      exposures or nuclear proteins other than APOE

    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Genetic, epidemiologic, and biochemical evidence suggests that
      apolipoprotein E, low-density lipoprotein receptors, and lipid metabolism
      play important roles in sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To
      identify novel candidate genes associated with sporadic AD. DESIGN: We
      performed an unbiased microarray screen for genes differentially expressed
      in lymphoblasts of patients with sporadic AD and prioritized 1 gene
      product for further characterization in AD brain. SETTING: Emory
      University, Atlanta, Ga. SUBJECTS: Cell lines were used from 14 patients
      with AD and 9 normal human control subjects. RESULTS: Six genes were
      differentially expressed in lymphoblasts of 2 independent groups of
      patients with probable AD and autopsy-proven AD. We hypothesized that 1 of
      the genes, termed low-density lipoprotein receptor relative with 11
      binding repeats (LR11) (reduced 1.8- and 2.5-fold in AD lymphoblasts vs
      controls), might be associated with sporadic AD on the basis of its
      function as neuronal apolipoprotein E receptor. We found dramatic and
      consistent loss of immunocytochemical staining for LR11 in histologically
      normal-appearing neurons in AD brains. This reduction of LR11 protein was
      confirmed by quantitative Western blotting (P =.01). CONCLUSIONS: There is
      loss of the microarray-derived candidate, LR11, in neurons of AD brains.
      This study shows that microarray analysis of widely available lymphoblasts
      derived from patients with AD holds promise as a primary screen for
      candidate genes associated with AD

      The human amyloid-beta precursor protein770 mutation V717F generates

      One of the familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) encodes the
      amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) substitution mutation V717F. This
      mutation is relevant to AD research, since it has been utilized to
      generate transgenic mice models to study AD pathology and therapeutic
      interventions. Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides were obtained from the
      cerebral tissue of three familial AD subjects carrying the AbetaPP V717F
      mutation. A combination of ultracentrifugation, size-exclusion, and
      reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, tryptic and cyanogen
      bromide hydrolysis, amino acid analysis, and matrix-assisted laser
      desorption ionization and surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization
      mass spectrometry was used to characterize the familial AD mutant Abeta
      peptides. The AbetaPP V717F mutation, located 4-6 residues beyond the
      wild-type AbetaPP gamma-secretase cleavage site, yielded longer Abeta
      peptides with C termini between residues 43 and 54. In the cerebral cortex
      these peptides aggregated into thin water- and SDS-insoluble amyloid
      bundles that condensed into flocculent spherical plaques. In the
      leptomeningeal arteries the amyloid was deposited in moderate amounts and
      was primarily composed of the shorter and more soluble Abeta species
      ending at residues 40, 42, and 44. The single V717F mutation in AbetaPP
      results in distinctive and drastic changes in the length and tertiary
      structure of Abeta peptides, which appear to be responsible for the
      earlier clinical manifestations of dementia and death of these patients

      Comprehensive association analysis of APOE regulatory region polymorphisms
      in Alzheimer disease
    journal: Neurogenetics.

    issue: 4
    pages: 201-208
    abstract: >-
      Several recent case-control studies have examined the association between
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the
      apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) and risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), with
      conflicting results. We assessed the relation between five APOE region
      SNPs and risk of AD in both case-control and family-based analyses. We
      observed a statistically significant association with the +5361T allele in
      the overall case-control analysis (P value=0.04) after adjusting for the
      known effect of the APOE-4 allele. Further analysis revealed this
      association to be limited to carriers of the APOE-4 allele. Age-stratified
      analyses in the patients with age at onset of 80 years or greater and
      age-matched controls showed that the -219T allele (P value=0.009) and the
      +113C allele (P value=0.03) are associated with increased risk of AD.
      Despite these findings, haplotype and family-based association analyses
      were unable to provide evidence that the APOE region SNPs influenced risk
      of AD independent of the APOE-4 allele. In addition to risk, we tested for
      association between the SNPs and age at onset of AD, but found no
      association in the case-control or family based analyses. In conclusion,
      SNPs +5361, or a SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium, may confer some
      additional risk for developing AD beyond the risk due to APOE-4; however,
      the effect independent of APOE-4 is likely to be small

      Variation in the urokinase-plasminogen activator gene does not explain the

    abstract: >-
      Linkage studies indicate that the same region of chromosome 10 contains a
      risk locus for late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) and a QTL for plasma
      Abeta42 levels suggesting that a single locus may influence risk for AD by
      elevating plasma Abeta42 [Ertekin-Taner et al., 2000; Myers et al., 2000].
      A strong positional and biological candidate is the urokinase-plasminogen
      activator (PLAU) gene. Eight polymorphisms spanning the entire gene were
      examined using case control (CC) and family-based association methods. No
      association was observed by any method making it unlikely that variation
      in PLAU explains our linkage data

      Genetic association of ABCA1 or the ATP-binding cassette A1 transporter
      with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has recently been proposed for
      a haplotype comprised of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We
      have genotyped these and other ABCA1 SNPs in a LOAD case-control series of
      796 individuals (419 cases versus 377 controls) collected at Washington
      University. While our sample series is larger and thus presumably has
      greater power than any of the series used to implicate ABCA1, we were
      unable to replicate the published association, using either single markers
      or multiple marker haplotypes. Further, we did not observe significant and
      replicated association of other ABCA1 SNPs we examined with the disease,
      thus these ABCA1 variants do not appear to influence the risk of LOAD in
      this study

      Association of late-onset Alzheimer's disease with genetic variation in

    volume: 101
    issue: 44
    pages: 15688-15693
    abstract: >-
      Although several genes have been implicated in the development of the
      early-onset autosomal dominant form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the
      genetics of late-onset AD (LOAD) is complex. Loci on several chromosomes
      have been linked to the disease, but so far only the apolipoprotein E gene
      has been consistently shown to be a risk factor. We have performed a
      large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based association study,
      across the region of linkage on chromosome 12, in multiple case-control
      series totaling 1,089 LOAD patients and 1,196 control subjects and report
      association with SNPs in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
      (GAPD) gene. Subsequent analysis of GAPD paralogs on other chromosomes
      demonstrated association with two other paralogs. A significant
      association between LOAD and a compound genotype of the three GAPD genes
      was observed in all three sample sets. Individually, these SNPs make
      differential contributions to disease risk in each of the casecontrol
      series, suggesting that variants in functionally similar genes may account
      for series-to-series heterogeneity of disease risk. Our observations raise
      the possibility that GAPD genes are AD risk factors, a hypothesis that is
      consistent with the role of GAPD in neuronal apoptosis

      Alpha-T-catenin is expressed in human brain and interacts with the Wnt
      signaling pathway but is not responsible for linkage to chromosome 10 in
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Neuromolecular Med

    issue: 2
    pages: 133-46
    abstract: >-
      The gene encoding alpha-T-catenin, CTNNA3, is positioned within a region
      on chromosome 10, showing strong evidence of linkage to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD), and is therefore a good positional candidate gene for this
      disorder. We have demonstrated that alpha-T-catenin is expressed in human
      brain, and like other alpha-catenins, it inhibits Wnt signaling and is
      therefore also a functional candidate. We initially genotyped two
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene, in four independent
      samples comprising over 1200 cases and controls but failed to detect an
      association with either SNP. Similarly, we found no evidence for
      association between CTNNA3 and AD in a sample of subjects showing linkage
      to chromosome 10, nor were these SNPs associated with Abeta deposition in
      brain. To comprehensively screen the gene, we genotyped 30 additional SNPs
      in a subset of the cases and controls (n &#62; 700). None of these SNPs
      was associated with disease. Although an excellent candidate, we conclude
      that CTNNA3 is unlikely to account for the AD susceptibility locus on
      chromosome 10.

    abstract: >-
      Our institution is currently engaged in ongoing genetic studies of
      familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), which include clinical ascertainment
      and brain autopsy of both affected and non-affected family members. Here
      we describe the analysis of 22 AD families, each with at least one family
      member with a postmortem diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). For
      this study, 47 brains were examined according to NINCDS-Reagan Institute
      criteria for the diagnosis of AD. Lewy body pathology was evaluated with
      alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry. Four families, with either one or
      two autopsies showing Lewy body pathology, demonstrated linkage to 12p.
      Five families had two or more autopsies with Lewy body pathology, but
      their linkage status was unknown. The remaining 13 families had one
      autopsy demonstrating Lewy bodies. These findings suggest that at least
      one pathological form of DLB may be familial. In some families, the
      pathological phenotype is identical in all examined affected family
      members; but in others, there may be several pathologies that coexist.
      Careful neuropathological examination of affected family members may prove
      critical for future genetic analysis of AD and DLB

      Ordered-subsets linkage analysis detects novel Alzheimer disease loci on

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex disorder characterized by a wide
      range, within and between families, of ages at onset of symptoms.
      Consideration of age at onset as a covariate in genetic-linkage studies
      may reduce genetic heterogeneity and increase statistical power.
      Ordered-subsets analysis includes continuous covariates in linkage
      analysis by rank ordering families by a covariate and summing LOD scores
      to find a subset giving a significantly increased LOD score relative to
      the overall sample. We have analyzed data from 336 markers in 437
      multiplex (&#62;/=2 sampled individuals with AD) families included in a
      recent genomic screen for AD loci. To identify genetic heterogeneity by
      age at onset, families were ordered by increasing and decreasing mean and
      minimum ages at onset. Chromosomewide significance of increases in the LOD
      score in subsets relative to the overall sample was assessed by
      permutation. A statistically significant increase in the nonparametric
      multipoint LOD score was observed on chromosome 2q34, with a peak LOD
      score of 3.2 at D2S2944 (P=.008) in 31 families with a minimum age at
      onset between 50 and 60 years. The LOD score in the chromosome 9p region
      previously linked to AD increased to 4.6 at D9S741 (P=.01) in 334 families
      with minimum age at onset between 60 and 75 years. LOD scores were also
      significantly increased on chromosome 15q22: a peak LOD score of 2.8
      (P=.0004) was detected at D15S1507 (60 cM) in 38 families with minimum age
      at onset &#62;/=79 years, and a peak LOD score of 3.1 (P=.0006) was
      obtained at D15S153 (62 cM) in 43 families with mean age at onset &#62;80
      years. Thirty-one families were contained in both 15q22 subsets,
      indicating that these results are likely detecting the same locus. There
      is little overlap in these subsets, underscoring the utility of age at
      onset as a marker of genetic heterogeneity. These results indicate that
      linkage to chromosome 9p is strongest in late-onset AD and that regions on
      chromosome 2q34 and 15q22 are linked to early-onset AD and very-late-onset
      AD, respectively

      The Q7R Saitohin gene polymorphism is not associated with Alzheimer

    abstract: >-
      Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the
      association of the Q7R polymorphism in the Saitohin gene with late-onset
      Alzheimer disease (AD). Given that AD is a tauopathy but no mutations or
      polymorphisms in Tau have been consistently associated with AD, and that
      Saitohin is nested in intron 9 of Tau and shares a similar expression
      pattern, we tested this association in 690 multiplex AD families and in a
      case-control sample (903 patients and 320 controls). We found no evidence
      of significant association of this polymorphism with risk of AD using
      family-based and case-control tests of association

      Glutathione S-transferase omega-1 modifies age-at-onset of Alzheimer
      disease and Parkinson disease
    journal: Hum.Mol.Genet.
    volume: 12
    issue: 24
    pages: 3259-3267
    abstract: >-
      We previously reported genetic linkage of loci controlling age-at-onset in
      Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) to a 15 cM region on
      chromosome 10q. Given the large number of genes in this initial starting
      region, we applied the process of 'genomic convergence' to prioritize and
      reduce the number of candidate genes for further analysis. As our second
      convergence factor we performed gene expression studies on hippocampus
      obtained from AD patients and controls. Analysis revealed that four of the
      genes [stearoyl-CoA desaturase; NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 1 beta
      subcomplex 8; protease, serine 11; and glutathione S-transferase, omega-1
      (GSTO1)] were significantly different in their expression between AD and
      controls and mapped to the 10q age-at-onset linkage region, the first
      convergence factor. Using 2814 samples from our AD dataset (1773 AD
      patients) and 1362 samples from our PD dataset (635 PD patients), allelic
      association studies for age-at-onset effects in AD and PD revealed no
      association for three of the candidates, but a significant association was
      found for GSTO1 (P=0.007) and a second transcribed member of the GST omega
      class, GSTO2 (P=0.005), located next to GSTO1. The functions of GSTO1 and
      GSTO2 are not well understood, but recent data suggest that GSTO1 maybe
      involved in the post-translational modification of the inflammatory
      cytokine interleukin-1beta. This is provocative given reports of the
      possible role of inflammation in these two neurodegenerative disorders

      Association of 3'-UTR polymorphisms of the oxidised LDL receptor 1 (OLR1)
      gene with Alzheimer's disease
    journal: J.Med.Genet.
    volume: 40
    issue: 6
    pages: 424-430
    abstract: >-
      Although possession of the epsilon 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene
      appears to be an important biological marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      susceptibility, strong evidence indicates that at least one additional
      risk gene exists on chromosome 12. Here, we describe an association of the
      3'-UTR +1073 C/T polymorphism of the OLR1 (oxidised LDL receptor 1) on
      chromosome 12 with AD in French sporadic (589 cases and 663 controls) and
      American familial (230 affected sibs and 143 unaffected sibs) populations.
      The age and sex adjusted odds ratio between the CC+CT genotypes versus the
      TT genotypes was 1.56 (p=0.001) in the French sample and 1.92 (p=0.02) in
      the American sample. Furthermore, we have discovered a new T/A
      polymorphism two bases upstream of the +1073 C/T polymorphism. This +1071
      T/A polymorphism was not associated with the disease, although it may
      weakly modulate the impact of the +1073 C/T polymorphism. Using 3'-UTR
      sequence probes, we have observed specific DNA protein binding with
      nuclear proteins from lymphocyte, astrocytoma, and neuroblastoma cell
      lines, but not from the microglia cell line. This binding was modified by
      both the +1071 T/A and +1073 C/T polymorphisms. In addition, a trend was
      observed between the presence or absence of the +1073 C allele and the
      level of astrocytic activation in the brain of AD cases. However,
      Abeta(40), Abeta(42), Abeta total, and Tau loads or the level of
      microglial cell activation were not modulated by the 3'-UTR OLR1
      polymorphisms. Finally, we assessed the impact of these polymorphisms on
      the level of OLR1 expression in lymphocytes from AD cases compared with
      controls. The OLR1 expression was significantly lower in AD cases bearing
      the CC and CT genotypes compared with controls with the same genotypes. In
      conclusion, our data suggest that genetic variation in the OLR1 gene may
      modify the risk of AD

      Sequence variation in the CHAT locus shows no association with late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Hum.Genet.
    volume: 113
    issue: 3
    pages: 258-267
    abstract: >-
      There is substantial evidence for a susceptibility gene for late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) on chromosome 10. One of the characteristic
      features of AD is the degeneration and dysfunction of the cholinergic
      system. The genes encoding choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and its
      vesicular transporter (VAChT), CHAT and SLC18A3 respectively, map to the
      linked region of chromosome 10 and are therefore both positional and
      obvious functional candidate genes for late-onset AD. We have screened
      both genes for sequence variants and investigated each for association
      with late-onset AD in up to 500 late-onset AD cases and 500 control DNAs
      collected in the UK. We detected a total of 17 sequence variants. Of
      these, 14 were in CHAT, comprising three non-synonymous variants (D7N in
      the S exon, A120T in exon 5 and L243F in exon 8), one synonymous change
      (H547H), nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms in intronic, untranslated or
      promoter regions, and a variable number of tandem repeats in intron 7.
      Three non-coding SNPs were detected in SLC18A3. None demonstrated any
      reproducible association with late-onset AD in our samples. Levels of
      linkage disequilibrium were generally low across the CHAT locus but two of
      the coding variants, D7N and A120T, proved to be in complete linkage
      disequilibrium

      AD is associated with the A2 allele of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA).
      However, it is not currently known whether there is any difference between
      A2 homozygotes and A2 heterozygotes. The authors studied 458 patients with
      AD and found that A2 homozygotes had earlier onset of AD than either A2
      heterozygotes (5.4 years, p = 0.002) or those without A2 (5.2 years, p =
      0.003). The &#34;recessive&#34; nature of this association suggests that
      loss of function at the HLA-A locus or a closely linked gene is associated
      with AD

      We performed a two-stage genome screen to search for novel risk factors
      for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The first stage involved genotyping
      292 affected sibling pairs using 237 markers spaced at approximately 20 cM
      intervals throughout the genome. In the second stage, we genotyped 451
      affected sibling pairs (ASPs) with an additional 91 markers, in the 16
      regions where the multipoint LOD score was greater than 1 in stage I. Ten
      regions maintained LOD scores in excess of 1 in stage II, on chromosomes 1
      (peak B), 5, 6, 9 (peaks A and B), 10, 12, 19, 21, and X. Our strongest
      evidence for linkage was on chromosome 10, where we obtained a peak
      multipoint LOD score (MLS) of 3.9. The linked region on chromosome 10
      spans approximately 44 cM from D10S1426 (59 cM) to D10S2327 (103 cM). To
      narrow this region, we tested for linkage disequilibrium with several of
      the stage II microsatellite markers. Of the seven markers we tested in
      family-based and case control samples, the only nominally positive
      association we found was with the 167 bp allele of marker D10S1217

      Age at onset in two common neurodegenerative diseases is genetically

    issue: 4
    pages: 985-993
    abstract: >-
      To identify genes influencing age at onset (AAO) in two common
      neurodegenerative diseases, a genomic screen was performed for AAO in
      families with Alzheimer disease (AD; n=449) and Parkinson disease (PD;
      n=174). Heritabilities between 40%--60% were found in both the AD and PD
      data sets. For PD, significant evidence for linkage to AAO was found on
      chromosome 1p (LOD = 3.41). For AD, the AAO effect of APOE (LOD = 3.28)
      was confirmed. In addition, evidence for AAO linkage on chromosomes 6 and
      10 was identified independently in both the AD and PD data sets.
      Subsequent unified analyses of these regions identified a single peak on
      chromosome 10q between D10S1239 and D10S1237, with a maximum LOD score of
      2.62. These data suggest that a common gene affects AAO in these two
      common complex neurodegenerative diseases

      Mitochondrial genetic variants and Alzheimer disease: a case-control study

    journal: Alzheimer Dis.Assoc.Disord.
    volume: 16
    issue: 1
    pages: 42011
    abstract: >-
      The T4336C mitochondrial genetic variant was associated with Alzheimer
      disease in several previous studies. Recent investigations, however,
      failed to confirm this association. We tested this association in newly
      diagnosed Alzheimer disease cases and controls of similar age and gender
      recruited from an established HMO serving Seattle, Washington and
      surrounding areas. In this, the largest case-control study reported to
      date, the T4336C variant was not associated with Alzheimer disease overall
      (present in 6 of 236 cases and 7 of 328 controls; odds ratio = 1.20, 95%
      CI 0.33 to 4.22). There was evidence of effect modification by
      Apolipoprotein E (APOE) status--among subjects with an APOE epsilon 4
      allele, the T4336C variant was associated with disease (present in 5 of
      139 cases and none of 82 controls; odds ratio = infinity, 95% CI 0.73 to
      infinity). APOE may be an important modifier of the T4336C effect,
      potentially explaining variable findings across previous studies.
      Alternatively, the positive findings reported to date may simply reflect
      the problem of &#34;type I&#34; error inherent in genetic association
      studies. Substantially larger samples than are currently available would
      be required to resolve this question. G5460(A/T) variants were also
      investigated and found not to be associated with Alzheimer disease

    title: The role of TNF and its receptors in Alzheimer's disease

    abstract: >-
      Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important proinflammatory cytokine that
      is upregulated in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and involved with AD
      genes. Several TNF promoter polymorphisms that increase expression are
      associated with inflammatory and infectious diseases. We previously
      reported results that detected a AD associated region near the TNF gene.
      Using family-based association tests we also reported an association
      between AD and a TNF haplotype in sibling-pair families, and a significant
      increase in the mean age of onset for a group of African-American AD
      patients carrying this same haplotype. Previous reports have shown that
      that the chromosome 1p and chromosome 12p regions are linked to late-onset
      AD. These two regions harbor TNF receptors (TNFR) 2 and 1, respectively,
      and binding to them mediates biological effects of TNF. We found a
      significant asssociation of a TNFR2 exon 6 polymorphism with late-onset AD
      in families with no individuals possessing the APOE E4E4 genotype under a
      dominant model. We found no significant association of three polymorphisms
      in the TNFR1 gene to AD. These results provide further evidence for the
      involvement of TNF in the pathogenesis of AD

      Senile dementia associated with amyloid beta protein angiopathy and tau
      perivascular pathology but not neuritic plaques in patients homozygous for
      the APOE-epsilon4 allele
    journal: Acta Neuropathol.

    abstract: >-
      Amyloid beta protein deposition in cortical and leptomeningeal vessels,
      causing the most common type of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, is found in
      sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is the principal
      feature in the hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch
      type. The presence of the Apolipopriotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 allele has
      been implicated as a risk factor for AD and the development of cerebral
      amyloid angiopathy in AD. We report clinical, pathological and biochemical
      studies on two APOE-epsilon4 homozygous subjects, who had senile dementia
      and whose main neuropathological feature was a severe and diffuse amyloid
      angiopathy associated with perivascular tau neurofibrillary pathology.
      Amyloid beta protein and ApoE immunoreactivity were observed in
      leptomeningeal vessels as well as in medium-sized and small vessels and
      capillaries in the parenchyma of the neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus,
      cerebellum, midbrain, pons, and medulla. The predominant peptide form of
      amyloid beta protein was that terminating at residue Val40, as determined
      by immunohistochemistry, amino acid sequence and mass spectrometry
      analysis. A crown of tau-immunopositive cell processes was consistently
      present around blood vessels. DNA sequence analysis of the Amyloid
      Precursor Protein gene and Presenilin-1 (PS-1) gene revealed no mutations.
      In these APOE-epsilon4 homozygous patients, the pathological process
      differed from that typically seen in AD in that they showed a heavy burden
      of perivascular tau-immunopositive cell processes associated with severe
      amyloid beta protein angiopathy, neurofibrillary tangles, some cortical
      Lewy bodies and an absence of neuritic plaques. These cases emphasize the
      concept that tau deposits may be pathogenetically related to amyloid beta
      protein deposition

      Cerebral metabolic and cognitive decline in persons at genetic risk for

    abstract: >-
      The major known genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), apolipoprotein
      E-4 (APOE-4), is associated with lowered parietal, temporal, and posterior
      cingulate cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with a clinical
      diagnosis of AD. To determine cognitive and metabolic decline patterns
      according to genetic risk, we investigated cerebral metabolic rates by
      using positron emission tomography in middle-aged and older nondemented
      persons with normal memory performance. A single copy of the APOE-4 allele
      was associated with lowered inferior parietal, lateral temporal, and
      posterior cingulate metabolism, which predicted cognitive decline after 2
      years of longitudinal follow-up. For the 20 nondemented subjects followed
      longitudinally, memory performance scores did not decline significantly,
      but cortical metabolic rates did. In APOE-4 carriers, a 4% left posterior
      cingulate metabolic decline was observed, and inferior parietal and
      lateral temporal regions demonstrated the greatest magnitude (5%) of
      metabolic decline after 2 years. These results indicate that the
      combination of cerebral metabolic rates and genetic risk factors provides
      a means for preclinical AD detection that will assist in response
      monitoring during experimental treatments

      Fine mapping of the chromosome 12 late-onset Alzheimer disease locus:
      potential genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity
    journal: Am.J.Hum.Genet.
    volume: 66
    issue: 3
    pages: 922-932
    abstract: >-
      Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the only confirmed susceptibility gene for
      late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). In a recent genomic screen of 54
      families with late-onset AD, we detected significant evidence for a second
      late-onset AD locus located on chromosome 12 between D12S373 and D12S390.
      Linkage to this region was strongest in 27 large families with at least
      one affected individual without an APOE-4 allele, suggesting that APOE and
      the chromosome 12 locus might have independent effects. We have since
      genotyped several additional markers across the region, to refine the
      linkage results. In analyzing these additional data, we have addressed the
      issue of heterogeneity in the data set by weighting results by clinical
      and neuropathologic features, sibship size, and APOE genotype. When
      considering all possible affected sib pairs (ASPs) per nuclear family, we
      obtained a peak maximum LOD score between D12S1057 and D12S1042. The
      magnitude and location of the maximum LOD score changed when different
      weighting schemes were used to control for the number of ASPs contributed
      by each nuclear family. Using the affected-relative-pair method
      implemented in GENEHUNTER-PLUS, we obtained a maximum LOD score between
      D12S398 and D12S1632, 25 cM from the original maximum LOD score. These
      results indicate that family size influences the location estimate for the
      chromosome 12 AD gene. The results of conditional linkage analysis by use
      of GENEHUNTER-PLUS indicated that evidence for linkage to chromosome 12
      was stronger in families with affected individuals lacking an APOE-4
      allele; much of this evidence came from families with affected individuals
      with neuropathologic diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Taken
      together, these results indicate that the chromosome 12 locus acts
      independently of APOE to increase the risk of late-onset familial AD and
      that it may be associated with the DLB variant of AD

      Lewy body and Alzheimer pathology in a family with the amyloid-beta

    issue: 2
    pages: 145-152
    abstract: >-
      Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene cause one form of
      early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). One such family has been
      studied genetically and neuropathologically and represents the basis of
      the present report. Four siblings with the APP717 Val to Ile mutation,
      aged 59, 65, 61 and 64 years, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyped 2,4 (first
      three) and 2,3 respectively, had severe AD, Braak stage VI with frequent
      neurofibrillary tangles in the primary visual cortex, Brodmann area 17.
      The first one also met McKeith criteria for the limbic stage of dementia
      with Lewy bodies but did not have substantia nigra Lewy bodies. The second
      two met McKeith criteria for the neocortical stage of dementia with Lewy
      bodies and both had substantia nigra Lewy bodies. The fourth had AD but no
      Lewy bodies. A cousin without the APP717 mutation who was APOE 3, 4,
      developed dementia at age 60 and died at age 75. She had severe
      cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, less severe AD, Braak stage V, with
      sparing of area 17. She also had Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and
      in the cortex and met McKeith criteria for neocortical stage of dementia
      with Lewy bodies. Extrapyramidal features were present in all five. Lewy
      bodies have been described in 53% of reported autopsies on individuals
      with the APP717 Val to Ile mutation coincident with dementia and AD
      neuropathologic changes. These observations suggest an association between
      the chromosome 21 APP mutation and Lewy body formation, possibly mediated
      by other environmental or genetic factors

      Presymptomatic genetic Testing with an APP Mutation in Early-Onset
      Alzheimer Disease: A Descriptive Study of Sibship Dynamics

    volume: 9
    issue: 4
    pages: 327-341
    abstract: >-
      Early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) accounts for only 5% of all cases of
      Alzheimer disease. To date, mutations in three different genes, the
      Amyloid precursor protein (APP), Presenilin 1 (PS1), and Presenilin 2
      (PS2), have been identified as causative in early-onset AD, making
      predictive testing possible. Predictive testing for early-onset Alzheimer
      disease is a relatively new phenomenon. This paper describes the process
      of identifying a new mutation in the APP gene associated with early-onset
      AD, notifying family members, and offering participation in research as
      well as predictive testing. The goal is to share the complexities of
      predictive testing in a sibship newly identified as being at risk for an
      adult-onset, incurable neurodegenerative disease.

    issue: 42257
    pages: 1343-52
    abstract: >-
      Four genes affecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD)(AP, PS1, PS2, and APOE) have
      been identified and a fifth potential gene localized to chromosome 12.
      Collectively, these genes explain at most half of the genetic effect in
      AD. Understanding the genetics of AD is critical to developing new
      treatments. The quest to find the remaining AD genes led us to undertake a
      large genomic screen using over 466 families (730 affected sibpairs) in
      late-onset AD. In conjunction with this increase in power, we initiated
      several novel approaches to identify potential AD-related genes. This
      included stratification of the data into an autopsy-confirmed subset of
      199 AD families. Each of these targeted analyses resulted in the
      identification of novel regions containing potential AD genetic risk
      factors. Our most significant finding was on chromosome 9 in the
      autopsy-confirmed subset where we obtained an MLS of 4.31. These
      approaches, together with new methodologies such as conditional linkage
      analysis, generalized family-based association tests (PDT), and a new
      generation of genetic markers (SNPs), opens the door for additional AD
      gene discovery. Such strategies are necessary if we are to understand the
      subtle and complex threads that, woven together, create the intricate
      tapestry of AD.

    abstract: >-
      The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the only genetic risk factor that has
      so far been linked to risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
      However, 50 percent of Alzheimer's disease cases do not carry an APOE4
      allele, suggesting that other risk factors must exist. We performed a
      two-stage genome-wide screen in sibling pairs with LOAD to detect other
      susceptibility loci. Here we report evidence for an Alzheimer's disease
      locus on chromosome 10. Our stage one multipoint lod score (logarithm of
      the odds ratio for linkage/no linkage) of 2.48 (266 sibling pairs)
      increased to 3.83 in stage 2 (429 sibling pairs) close to D10S1225 (79
      centimorgans). This locus modifies risk for Alzheimer's disease
      independent of APOE genotype

      CONTEXT: Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia. Mutations
      in the genes amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1(PS1) and
      presenilin 2(PS2) have been found in early-onset familial forms of
      Alzheimer disease OBJECTIVE: To determine the cause of dementia in a
      family with early-onset illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A
      family with a history of dementia was referred to the Indiana Alzheimer
      Disease Center, Indianapolis. All the research in this study was done in a
      university or university hospital. The proband and her 4 siblings took
      part in the study. The proband, who is still alive, showed symptoms of
      Alzheimer disease at 38 years of age. Genomic DNA was obtained from blood
      samples of 5 family members. The APPandPS1genes of the proband were
      screened for mutations by amplification followed by direct sequencing.
      RESULTS: Sequence of exon 17 of the APPgene revealed a single nucleotide
      (guanine to cytosine) substitution in 1 allele, resulting in an amino acid
      change at codon 717 (valine to leucine). Each of the proband's siblings
      were tested for this mutation by direct sequencing. Two of the 4 were
      found to have the mutation; one of whom was recently clinically diagnosed
      at the age of 36 years. CONCLUSIONS: A novel mutation in the APPgene
      (V717L) has been found in a family with a history of dementia, beginning
      in the mid to late 30s. The age of onset in this family is earlier than
      most of the other families with Alzheimer disease who also have
      APPmutations. Arch Neurol. 2000

      SNPing away at complex diseases: analysis of single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms around APOE in Alzheimer disease
    journal: Am.J.Hum.Genet.
    volume: 67
    issue: 2
    pages: 383-394
    abstract: >-
      There has been great interest in the prospects of using single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the search for complex disease genes, and several
      initiatives devoted to the identification and mapping of SNPs throughout
      the human genome are currently underway. However, actual data
      investigating the use of SNPs for identification of complex disease genes
      are scarce. To begin to look at issues surrounding the use of SNPs in
      complex disease studies, we have initiated a collaborative SNP mapping
      study around APOE, the well-established susceptibility gene for late-onset
      Alzheimer disease (AD). Sixty SNPs in a 1.5-Mb region surrounding APOE
      were genotyped in samples of unrelated cases of AD, in controls, and in
      families with AD. Standard tests were conducted to look for association of
      SNP alleles with AD, in cases and controls. We also used family-based
      association analyses, including recently developed methods to look for
      haplotype association. Evidence of association (P&#60;/=.05) was
      identified for 7 of 13 SNPs, including the APOE-4 polymorphism, spanning
      40 kb on either side of APOE. As expected, very strong evidence for
      association with AD was seen for the APOE-4 polymorphism, as well as for
      two other SNPs that lie &#60;16 kb from APOE. Haplotype analysis using
      family data increased significance over that seen in single-locus tests
      for some of the markers, and, for these data, improved localization of the
      gene. Our results demonstrate that associations can be detected at SNPs
      near a complex disease gene. We found that a high density of markers will
      be necessary in order to have a good chance of including SNPs with

      The discussion of the prospects of using a dense map of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify disease genes with association analysis
      has been extensive. However, there is little empiric evidence to support
      this strategy. To begin to examine the practical issues surrounding this
      methodology, we identified 10 SNPs in the region immediately surrounding
      the apolipoprotein E locus (APOE), an established susceptibility gene for
      Alzheimer disease. Our goal was to examine patterns of allelic association
      to begin to investigate the question of whether APOE could have been
      identified using SNPs. Our strongest evidence of association was at the 2
      SNPs immediately flanking APOE

      Association of an interleukin 1 alpha polymorphism with Alzheimer's
      disease
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 55
    issue: 4
    pages: 480-483
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: Retrospective epidemiologic studies suggest that individuals
      exposed to anti-inflammatory agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs have a lower probability of developing AD as well as an older age at
      onset for the illness. Neuroinflammation may play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of AD. Interleukin 1 (IL-1), a potent proinflammatory
      cytokine, is colocalized immunohistochemically to neuritic plaques, a
      requisite neuropathologic feature for AD. A polymorphism in the
      5'-flanking regulatory region at -889 of the IL-1 alpha gene (a C-to-T
      transition designated as IL-1A[-889] allele 2) may cause an overexpression
      of IL-1 alpha, a finding shown to be associated with inflammatory
      diseases. The IL-1A(-889) allele 2 polymorphism may be associated with AD
      pathogenesis. METHODS: A total of 259 patients with AD and 192 nondemented
      control subjects were included from two different centers (Indianapolis,
      IN, and Munich, Germany). Genotyping for APOE alleles and IL-1A(-889)
      allele 2 was performed by PCR-based amplification followed by restrictive
      endonuclease digestion. Statistical analyses were conducted by center-,
      gender group-, and age group-stratified Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios, CI,
      and p values. RESULTS: The allele frequency of IL-1A(-889) allele 2 was
      46% in clinically diagnosed patients with probable AD versus 34% in
      control subjects from the combined centers. CONCLUSION: The authors found
      an increased risk for AD with an estimated Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio of
      1.68 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.6; p = 0.022) for heterozygous carriers and 7.2 (95%
      CI 2.0 to 24.5; p = 0.003) for individuals homozygous for IL-1A(-889)
      allele 2. They found no evidence for an interaction between the IL-1A and
      the apoE epsilon 4 polymorphisms (carriers and homozygotes), age, or
      gender with regard to conferred risk. The data strongly support an
      association between the IL-1A(-889) allele 2, especially in homozygotes,
      and later-onset AD

    title: Alpha2 macroglobulin and the risk of Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 54
    issue: 2
    pages: 438-442
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: alpha2 Macroglobulin is a panproteinase inhibitor that is
      found immunohistochemically in neuritic plaques, a requisite
      neuropathologic feature of AD. Recently, a pentanucleotide deletion near
      the 5' end of the &#34;bait region&#34; of the alpha2 macroglobulin (A2M)
      gene was reported to be associated with AD in a large cohort of sibpairs,
      in which the mutation conferred a similar odds ratio with AD as the
      APOE-epsilon4 allele for carriers of at least one copy of the A2M gene
      (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio, 3.56). METHODS: We studied three independent
      association samples of AD patients (n = 309) with an age range of 50 to 94
      years and representative controls (n = 281) to characterize the allele
      frequency of the pentanucleotide deletion in this cohort. We detected the
      mutation near the 5' splice site of exon 18 using standard PCR and
      restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. The results were
      adjusted for age, gender, education, and APOE polymorphism. RESULTS: We
      found that the A2M gene polymorphism conferred an increased risk for AD,
      with an estimated Mantel-Haenszel ratio of 1.5 (95% CI 1.1 to 2.2; p =
      0.025). There was no age- or gender-dependent increase in A2M gene allele
      frequencies in AD patients compared with controls. The combined sample
      showed the expected association between AD and APOE-epsilon 4. In one of
      our three samples there was an interaction between the A2M and
      APOE-epsilon4 genes, but the other two samples showed no interaction
      between the two risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support an association
      between the A2M gene and AD. This association is less pronounced, however,
      in our cohort than in the previously reported sample of sibpairs

    abstract: >-
      Although it is clear that apoE plays an important role in the genetics of
      late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), evidence exists that additional genes
      may play a role in AD, and estimates of the total contribution of apoE to
      the variance in onset of AD vary widely. Unfortunately, little information
      is available on the number and contribution of additional genes. We
      estimated the number of additional quantitative-trait loci and their
      contribution to the variance in age at onset of AD, as well as the
      contribution of apoE and sex, in an oligogenic segregation analysis of 75
      families (742 individuals) ascertained for members with late-onset AD. We
      found evidence that four additional loci make a contribution to the
      variance in age at onset of late-onset AD that is similar to or greater in
      magnitude than that made by apoE, with one locus making a contribution
      several times greater than that of apoE. Additionally, we confirmed
      previous findings of a dose effect for the apoE varepsilon4 allele, a
      protective effect for the varepsilon2 allele, evidence for allelic
      interactions at the apoE locus, and a small protective effect for males.
      Furthermore, although we estimate that the apoE genotype can make a
      difference of &#60;/=17 years in age at onset of AD, our estimate of the
      contribution of apoE (7%-9%) to total variation in onset of AD is somewhat
      smaller than that which has previously been reported. Our results suggest
      that several genes that have not yet been localized may play a larger role
      than does apoE in late-onset AD

      Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a proinflammatory cytokine, may be involved
      in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) based on observations that
      senile plaques have been found to upregulate proinflammatory cytokines.
      Additionally, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been found to
      delay and prevent the onset of AD. A collaborative genome-wide scan for AD
      genes in 266 late-onset families implicated a 20 centimorgan region at
      chromosome 6p21.3 that includes the TNF gene. Three TNF polymorphisms, a
      -308 TNF promoter polymorphism, whose TNF2 allele is associated with
      autoimmune inflammatory diseases and strong transcriptional activity, the
      -238 TNF promoter polymorphism, and the microsatellite TNFa, whose 2
      allele is associated with a high TNF secretion, were typed in 145 families
      consisting of 562 affected and unaffected siblings. These polymorphisms
      formed a haplotype, 2-1-2, respectively, that was significantly associated
      with AD (P = 0.005) using the sibling disequilibrium test. Singly, the
      TNFa2 allele was also significantly associated (P = 0.04) with AD in these
      145 families. This TNF association with AD lends further support for an
      inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of AD. Am. J. Med. Genet.

      BACKGROUND: The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is the
      chief known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, the most common
      cause of dementia late in life. To determine the relation between brain
      responses to tasks requiring memory and the genetic risk of Alzheimer's
      disease, we performed APOE genotyping and functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) of the brain in older persons with intact cognition.
      METHODS: We studied 30 subjects (age, 47 to 82 years) who were
      neurologically normal, of whom 16 were carriers of the APOE epsilon4
      allele and 14 were homozygous for the APOE epsilon3 allele. The mean age
      and level of education were similar in the two groups. Patterns of brain
      activation during functional MRI scanning were determined while subjects
      memorized and recalled unrelated pairs of words and while subjects rested
      between such periods. Memory was reassessed in 14 subjects two years
      later. RESULTS: Both the magnitude and the extent of brain activation
      during memory-activation tasks in regions affected by Alzheimer's disease,
      including the left hippocampal, parietal, and prefrontal regions, were
      greater among the carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele than among the
      carriers of the APOE epsilon3 allele. During periods of recall, the
      carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele had a greater average increase in
      signal intensity in the hippocampal region (1.03 percent vs. 0.62 percent,
      P&#60;0.001) and a greater mean (+/-SD) number of activated regions
      throughout the brain (15.9+/-6.2 vs. 9.4+/-5.5, P=0.005) than did carriers
      of the APOE epsilon3 allele. Longitudinal assessment after two years
      indicated that the degree of base-line brain activation correlated with
      degree of decline in memory. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of brain activation
      during tasks requiring memory differ depending on the genetic risk of
      Alzheimer's disease and may predict a subsequent decline in memory

    abstract: >-
      In a series of sibpairs with late onset Alzheimer's disease, we have
      examined the segregation of the loci involved in the early onset,
      autosomal dominant form of the disorder by using flanking microsatellite
      repeat markers: thus we have used APP-PCR3 and D21S210 to examine the
      segregation of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) gene, the markers
      DI 4S77 and D14S284 to examine the segregation of the presenilin 1 (PSI)
      gene and the markers D1S227, D1S249 and D1S419 to examine the segregation
      of presenilin 2 (PS2). We carried out our analyses on the whole dataset of
      291 affected sibpairs, and on subsets comprising those sibpairs in which
      neither had an apolipoprotein E4 allele (65 affected sibpairs) and those
      in which both had an apolipoprotein E4 allele (165 affected sibpairs). We
      used the programs SPLINK to generate allele frequencies and MAPMAKER/SIBS
      to analyze our results. We examined the segregation of the markers D19S908
      and D19S918 that are close to the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene as a
      positive control to assess whether the methods we are employing have the
      capability to identify known loci. The sibpair approach to the
      identification of genetic risk loci is relatively insensitive as indicated
      by the failure of the ApoE locus to reach statistical significance (P =
      0.06). Nevertheless, these data suggest that neither the PS1 nor the PS2
      gene is a major locus for late-onset AD, but that the APP gene cannot be
      ruled out as a risk locus in those sibships without an E4 allele (P =
      0.014). The possibility that APP is indeed a locus for late onset disease
      will need confirmation in other series of familial cases

      Structure of tau exon 10 splicing regulatory element RNA and

      Coding region and intronic mutations in the tau gene cause frontotemporal
      dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Intronic mutations and
      some missense mutations increase splicing in of exon 10, leading to an
      increased ratio of four-repeat to three-repeat tau isoforms. Secondary
      structure predictions have led to the proposal that intronic mutations and
      one missense mutation destabilize a putative RNA stem-loop structure
      located close to the splice-donor site of the intron after exon 10. We
      have determined the three-dimensional structure of this tau exon 10
      splicing regulatory element RNA by NMR spectroscopy. We show that it forms
      a stable, folded stem-loop structure whose thermodynamic stability is
      reduced by frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome
      17 mutations and increased by compensatory mutations. By exon trapping,
      the reduction in thermodynamic stability is correlated with increased
      splicing in of exon 10

      The apolipoprotein E (APOE)-4 allele is a major risk factor for late-onset
      Alzheimer disease (AD), but it does not account for all the genetic
      variation in late-onset AD; thus, other genetic markers must be examined.
      Previous studies suggest an HLA-A2 allele association with risk and
      earlier onset age of AD. Because these effects may be additive to those of
      APOE-4, we studied HLA-A2 and APOE-4 frequencies in AD patients and
      cognitively intact controls. A total of 712 unrelated Caucasian subjects
      included 479 patients with AD (435 sporadic, 44 familial) and 233
      controls. Patients (mean+/-SD age 73.9+/-7.9 years, range 42-93 years) had
      probable AD, according to standard diagnostic criteria; controls
      (mean+/-SD age 70.4+/-8.5 years, range 37-92 years) were cognitively
      intact. APOE and HLA-A2 typing used polymerase chain reaction to indicate
      the number of APOE-4 alleles present as well as the presence (A1/A2, A2/A2
      genotypes) or absence (A1/A1 genotype) of HLA-A2. A two-way analysis of
      variance was used to assess the effect of the HLA-A2 allele on age at
      onset of dementia. No association between HLA-A2 and APOE-4 was found, and
      the presence of HLA-A2 allele did not increase AD risk. There was also no
      evidence for an association between HLA-A2 and earlier onset age of AD.
      Examination age, sex, family history of AD, and recruitment site had no
      influence on these results. In conclusion, the HLA-A2 allele did not
      influence AD risk or onset age in this study population. A2
      heterozygosity, and population differences, including stratification
      sub-structures, and other undetermined factors could contribute to
      discrepant findings among studies

      The epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is strongly associated
      with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Caucasian populations, but our
      studies suggest that APOE epsilon 4 is not a risk factor for AD in
      Nigerian blacks and is a weak risk factor in African-Americans. The
      prevalence of AD is lower in Nigerians than in African-Americans.
      Increased oxidative damage to macromolecules in brain tissue by reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) has been reported in AD. Here we examined the effects
      of endogenous and induced oxidative stress on total (nuclear and
      mitochondrial) DNA damage in lymphoblastoid cell lines (5 probable AD and
      3 controls) from Ibadan, Nigeria. Cells were exposed to 200 microM t-butyl
      peroxide (a generator of ROS) for 4 hours. Total DNA was isolated and
      digested with nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase. DNA fragments were
      separated by HPLC and the levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (OH8dG, an
      indicator of DNA damage) and deoxyguanosine (dG) determined. We did not
      detect a significant difference in the OH8dG/dG ratio in untreated or
      treated cell lines in the two groups, and this was independent of APOE
      genotype. We also examined, by Western blotting, the level of beta-amyloid
      precursor protein (APP) which is involved in AD. The level of the heat
      shock protein (HSP-70) was examined as a control. There was a slight
      decrease in levels of APP and HSP-70 following treatment. Studies in cell
      lines from Caucasian subjects have shown an increase in mitochondrial DNA
      damage following oxidative challenge. Our preliminary results suggest that
      African populations are less vulnerable to chemical-induced oxidative DNA
      damage

      We have genotyped 292 affected sibling pairs (ASPs) with Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) according to NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria and with onset
      ages of &#62;/=65 years using 237 microsatellite markers separated by an
      average distance of 16.3 cM. Data were analysed by SPLINK and
      MAPMAKER/SIBS on the whole sample of 292 ASPs and subsets of 162 ASPs
      where both members possessed an apolipoprotein E (APOE)straightepsilon4
      allele and 63 pairs where neither possessed anstraightepsilon4 allele.
      Sixteen peaks with a multipoint lod score (MLS) &#62;1 either in the whole
      sample, the straightepsilon4-positive or -negative subgroups were observed
      on chromosomes 1 (two peaks), 2, 5, 6, 9 (two peaks), 10 (two peaks), 12,
      13, 14, 19, 21 and X (two peaks). Simulation studies revealed that these
      findings exceeded those expected by chance, although many are likely to be
      false positives. The highest lod scores on chromosomes 1 (MLS 2.67), 9
      (MLS 2.38), 10 (MLS 2.27) and 19 (MLS 1.79) fulfilLander and Kruglyak's
      definition of 'suggestive' in that they would be expected to occur by
      chance once or less per genome scan. Several other peaks were only
      marginally less significant than this, in particular those on chromosomes
      14 (MLS 2.16), 5 (MLS 2.00), 12, close to alpha2-macroglobulin (MLS 1.91),
      and 21, close to amyloid precursor protein (MLS 1.77). This is the largest
      genome scan to date in AD and shows for the first time that this is a
      genetically complex disorder involving several, perhaps many, genes in
      addition to APOE. Moreover, our data will be of interest to those hoping
      to identify positional candidate genes using information emerging from
      neurobiological studies of AD

      A novel mutation in the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE*4 Pittsburgh) is

    abstract: >-
      Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand
      conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and DNA sequencing techniques, we
      identified a unique missense mutation (T--&#62;C) in exon 3 of the APOE
      gene which resulted in the substitution of pro-28 for leu-28. We screened
      1118 White cases of late-onset (&#62;60 years) Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      from three independent centers (Pittsburgh = 489, Indiana = 319, Mayo
      Clinic Rochester = 310) and 1123 controls (607 clinically assessed and 516
      individuals randomly ascertained from the general population). Two of the
      1123 control subjects had the pro-28 mutation (0.18%). However, this
      mutation was observed in heterozygous state in 2.66, 2.51 and 1.94% of the
      AD cases from Pittsburgh, Indiana and Mayo Clinic Rochester, respectively,
      with an overall frequency of 2.42%. All individuals with this mutation
      were carriers of the APOE*4 allele and hence the mutation was denoted as
      APOE*4 Pittsburgh (APOE*4P). Compared with the non-E*4P carriers, the E*4P
      carriers were associated with an increased risk of AD (odds ratio (OR)
      13.2) and this risk remained significant even after adjusting for the
      known effect of APOE*4 (OR 5.4). The risk associated with the E*4P/E*4
      combination was about five times (OR 29.1) the risk attributed to APOE*4
      carriers alone (OR 5.7). Our data indicates that the new mutation most
      likely exists in cis-orientation with APOE*4 and is associated with
      increased risk of developing AD

      Butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) is an enzyme expressed in most human tissues.
      Recently, an increased odds of carrying the K variant of BCHE (BCHE-K) was
      reported among Alzheimer disease (AD) cases as compared with controls. We
      tested our data set of 245 sporadic AD cases and 241 controls for an
      association between BCHE-K, APOE4, and AD using logistic regression and
      chi-square analyses. The sib transmission disequilibrium test (S-TDT) was
      also used to test for differences in BCHE-K allele frequencies between 163
      discordant sib-pairs selected from multiplex AD families. No statistically
      significant differences were noted between BCHE-K case and control allele
      frequencies even after stratifying by APOE4 status. S-TDT analysis between
      the BCHE-K variant and AD was also not significant (P = 0.52). We conclude
      that BCHE-K is not a major genetic risk factor for AD in our study
      population

      Multipoint oligogenic analysis of age-at-onset data with applications to

    issue: 3
    pages: 839-851
    abstract: >-
      It is usually difficult to localize genes that cause diseases with late
      ages at onset. These diseases frequently exhibit complex modes of
      inheritance, and only recent generations are available to be genotyped and
      phenotyped. In this situation, multipoint analysis using traditional exact
      linkage analysis methods, with many markers and full pedigree information,
      is a computationally intractable problem. Fortunately, Monte Carlo Markov
      chain sampling provides a tool to address this issue. By treating age at
      onset as a right-censored quantitative trait, we expand the methods used
      by Heath (1997) and illustrate them using an Alzheimer disease (AD) data
      set. This approach estimates the number, sizes, allele frequencies, and
      positions of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In this simultaneous
      multipoint linkage and segregation analysis method, the QTLs are assumed
      to be diallelic and to interact additively. In the AD data set, we were
      able to localize correctly, quickly, and accurately two known genes,
      despite the existence of substantial genetic heterogeneity, thus
      demonstrating the great promise of these methods for the dissection of
      late-onset oligogenic diseases

    abstract: >-
      We describe two extended haplotypes that cover the human tau gene. In a
      total of approximately 200 unrelated caucasian individuals there is
      complete disequilibrium between polymorphisms which span the gene (which
      covers approximately 100 kb of DNA). This suggests that the establishment
      of the two haplotypes was an ancient event and either that recombination
      is suppressed in this region, or that recombinant genes are selected
      against. Furthermore, we show that the more common haplotype (H1) is
      significantly over-represented in patients with progressive supranuclear
      palsy (PSP), extending earlier reports of an association between an
      intronic dinucleotide polymorphism and PSP

      Mutation in the tau gene in familial multiple system tauopathy with
      presenile dementia
    journal: Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A

    issue: 13

    abstract: >-
      Familial multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia (MSTD) is a
      neurodegenerative disease with an abundant filamentous tau protein
      pathology. It belongs to the group of familial frontotemporal dementias
      with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), a major class of
      inherited dementing disorders whose genetic basis is unknown. We now
      report a G to A transition in the intron following exon 10 of the gene for
      microtubule-associated protein tau in familial MSTD. The mutation is
      located at the 3' neighboring nucleotide of the GT splice-donor site and
      disrupts a predicted stem-loop structure. We also report an abnormal
      preponderance of soluble tau protein isoforms with four
      microtubule-binding repeats over isoforms with three repeats in familial
      MSTD. This most likely accounts for our previous finding that
      sarkosyl-insoluble tau protein extracted from the filamentous deposits in
      familial MSTD consists only of tau isoforms with four repeats. These
      findings reveal that a departure from the normal ratio of four-repeat to
      three-repeat tau isoforms leads to the formation of abnormal tau
      filaments. The results show that dysregulation of tau protein production
      can cause neurodegeneration and imply that the FTDP-17 gene is the tau
      gene. This work has major implications for Alzheimer's disease and other
      tauopathies

      No genetic association between the LRP receptor and sporadic or late-onset
      familial Alzheimer disease
    journal: Neurogenetics.

    pages: 179-183
    abstract: >-
      The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein gene (LRP1) is often
      mentioned as a candidate gene for Alzheimer disease (AD) because of its
      role as a receptor for apolipoprotein E (apoE), a major genetic risk
      factor for late-onset familial and sporadic AD. A recent association study
      of a tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism located 5' to the LRP1 gene
      detected an increase in the 87 base pair allele in AD cases compared to
      unaffected controls. Additionally, an independent study involving a
      genomic screen for genes associated with late-onset AD identified a region
      as a possible location of a late-onset AD gene on chromosome 12p between
      D12S373 and D12S390, about 10 cM proximal to LRP1. We examined 144
      late-onset multiplex AD families, 436 sporadic AD cases, and 240 controls
      and found no evidence of linkage or association of LRP1 and AD. Our data
      indicate that genetic variation of the LRP1 gene is not a major risk
      factor in the etiology of AD

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex genetic disorder. Linkage analysis
      has helped unravel a portion of the genetic component of AD by identifying
      four loci that play a role in the genetics of AD (amyloid precursor
      protein, presenilin 1, presenilin 2, and apolipoprotein E). These loci
      account for approximately 50% of the genetic etiology of AD. A total
      genomic screen is an efficient way to identify additional genetic effects
      in AD. A series of multiplex late-onset (&#62;60 years) AD families were
      ascertained (NINDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria) and sampled. A subset (n =
      16) of the largest families (52 affecteds with DNA, 83 unaffecteds with
      DNA) were used to rapidly screen the genome (n = 280 markers) for
      additional major genetic effects. Critical values for regional follow-up
      were p &#60; or =0.05 for SimIBD or sibpair analysis and/or a LOD score
      &#62; or = 1.00. Fifteen regions warranted initial follow-up based on
      these criteria. An additional screening set was used (n = 38 families, 89
      affecteds with DNA, 216 unaffecteds with DNA) for the follow-up analysis.
      These analyses revealed four regions of continued interest on chromosomes
      4, 6, 12, and 20. Chromosome 12 presented the strongest results. Peak two
      point &#34;affecteds only&#34; LOD scores were 1.3, 1.6, 2.7, and 2.2 and
      (affected relative pair SimIBD) p values were 0.04, 0.03, 0.14, and 0.04
      for D12S373, D12S1057, D12S1042, and D12S390, respectively. These markers
      span approximately 30 cm near the centromeric region of chromosome 12.
      Sibpair analysis resulted in two point Maximum Lod Score (MLS) results of
      0.4, 1.2, 3.2, and 1.0 for the above markers. Multipoint MLS analysis
      supported these findings. Saturation mapping of all available markers in
      the chromosome 12 region as well as further investigation of the regions
      on 4, 6, and 20 is ongoing with candidate gene analysis to follow

      A recent study showed modest evidence for an increased frequency of the

      compared with non-demented controls. To test this hypothesis, we examined
      this polymorphism in 621 rigorously evaluated patients and 502 control
      subjects (all caucasian) but were unable to detect an association between
      BH and AD even after controlling for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E

      inherited susceptibility to AD in the populations represented in this

      No association of alpha1-antichymotrypsin flanking region polymorphism and

    pages: 79-82
    abstract: >-
      The alpha1-antichymotrypsin (AACT)-155 allele was found elsewhere to have
      a significant effect on Alzheimer disease (AD) risk in individuals with at
      least one APOE-4 allele. We compared AACT genotypes of 284 cases of
      sporadic AD and 172 controls. The frequency of the AACT-155 allele did not
      differ significantly between cases and controls, either overall or when
      restricted to subjects with at least one APOE-4 allele. Logistic
      regression controlling for age and sex failed to show an effect due to
      AACT either alone or acting with APOE. There was no evidence of an
      interaction between APOE-4 and the AACT-155 allele to reduce age at onset.
      Thus, our data do not support an association of AACT-155 with risk or age
      at onset in AD

    title: D2 dopamine receptor A1 allele in Alzheimer disease and aging
    journal: Arch.Neurol.
    volume: 54
    issue: 3
    pages: 281-285
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE*4) allele is a major risk factor
      for the common forms of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), but does not
      account for all the genetic variation in late-onset AD; hence, other
      genetic markers must be examined. The D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) A1
      allele is associated with abnormal brain function and decreased DRD2s.
      These receptors are decreased in hippocampus and amygdala in AD, and
      allele frequencies may vary with age. OBJECTIVE: To study APOE and DRD2
      genotypes in patients with AD and cognitively intact controls of varying
      ages. DESIGN: The DRD2 and APOE genotypes were examined in 832 unrelated
      white subjects, including 554 patients with AD (486 sporadic; 68 familial)
      and 278 controls. Logistic regressions tested A1 allele effects on disease
      status and age, and DRD2 linkage with AD was investigated in 60 families
      with late-onset AD. SETTING: University medical centers. SUBJECTS:
      Patients (mean +/- SD age, 74.6 +/- 8.1 years; range, 52-98 years) had
      probable AD, according to standard consensus diagnostic criteria; controls
      (mean +/- SD age, 69.2 +/- 8.6 years; range, 50-93 years) were cognitively
      intact. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease status, age, and DRD2 linkage with
      AD. RESULTS: No association between the DRD2 and APOE alleles was found,
      and the presence of the A1 allele did not increase the risk for AD. There
      was also no evidence of linkage between DRD2 and AD. Age analyses,
      including both patients and controls, indicated a decrease in A1 allele
      frequency with age. CONCLUSIONS: The A1 allele does not contribute to AD
      risk, alone or in combination with the APOE*4 allele. The DRD2 A1 allele
      frequencies decrease with age in both patients and controls. Thus, studies
      of DRD2 disease association need to control for age

      No association or linkage between an intronic polymorphism of presenilin-1
      and sporadic or late-onset familial Alzheimer disease
    journal: Genet.Epidemiol.
    volume: 14
    issue: 3
    pages: 307-315
    abstract: >-
      Recent reports have shown an association between an intronic polymorphism
      of the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene and late-onset (age at onset &#62; 65)
      familial and sporadic (no family history) Alzheimer disease (AD). The
      reported association was independent of the effect of the only previously
      identified gene associated with late-onset AD, APOE. Blood samples were
      obtained from members of 122 multiplex AD families, 42 unrelated cases of
      AD with positive family histories of dementia, 456 sporadic cases of AD,
      and 317 controls of similar ages at examination to the cases. These
      samples were genotyped for an intronic polymorphism of the PSEN1 gene,
      located 3' to exon 8, and the data analyzed for evidence of association or
      linkage. The samples were also genotyped for APOE and the data analyzed to
      see if the association or linkage changed when controlling for APOE
      genotype. There was no statistically significant increase (at alpha = .01)
      in allele 1 (199 bp) or genotype 1/1 in the sporadic AD cases, or in a
      random sample of one affected from each multiplex family, compared to
      controls. When examining the effect of the PSEN1 polymorphism while
      controlling for APOE genotype, APOE genotype was strongly associated with
      AD, but the PSEN1 polymorphism genotype was not. Model-trait dependent
      (lod score) and independent (Sim1BD) methods detected no evidence of
      linkage between PSEN1 and AD. In this independent dataset, the previously
      reported association between the intronic PSEN1 polymorphism and AD cannot
      be confirmed, and the conclusion that PSEN1 is a major susceptibility gene
      for late-onset AD is not supported

      We examined the association of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and the
      risk of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 209 white early-onset
      sporadic cases (43% male) and 303 white controls (48% male) of similar age
      distribution. The risk of AD was significantly increased, relative to the
      3/3 genotype, in people with the 4/4, 3/4, and 2/4 genotypes, controlling
      for age at time of examination and sex. The 2/3 genotype reduced slightly
      the risk of AD, although the effect was not statistically significant. We
      conclude, contrary to some previous reports, that the ApoE epsilon2 allele
      does not increase the risk of early-onset sporadic AD.

      Complete genomic screen in late-onset familial Alzheimer disease. Evidence
      for a new locus on chromosome 12
    journal: JAMA
    volume: 278
    issue: 15
    pages: 1237-1241
    abstract: >-
      CONTEXT: Four genetic loci have been identified as contributing to
      Alzheimer disease (AD), including the amyloid precursor protein gene, the
      presenilin 1 gene, the presenilin 2 gene, and the apolipoprotein E gene,
      but do not account for all the genetic risk for AD. OBJECTIVE: To identify
      additional genetic risk factors for late-onset AD. DESIGN: A complete
      genomic screen was performed (N=280 markers). Critical values for
      chromosomal regional follow-up were a P value of .05 or less for affected
      relative pair analysis or sibpair analysis, a parametric lod score of 1.0
      or greater, or both. Regional follow-up included analysis of additional
      markers and a second data set. SETTING: Clinic populations in the
      continental United States. PATIENTS: From a series of multiplex families
      affected with late-onset (&#62; or =60 years) AD ascertained during the
      last 14 years (National Insititute of Neurological Disorders and
      Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association diagnostic
      criteria) and for which DNA has been obtained, a subset of 16 families
      (135 total family members, 52 of whom were patients with AD) was used for
      the genomic screen. A second subset of 38 families (216 total family
      members, 89 of whom were patients with AD) was used for the follow-up
      analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Linkage analysis results generated using
      both genetic model-dependent (lod score) and model-independent methods.
      RESULTS: Fifteen chromosomal regions warranted initial follow-up.
      Follow-up analyses revealed 4 regions of continued interest on chromosomes
      4, 6, 12, and 20, with the strongest results observed forchromosome 12.
      Peak 2-point affecteds-only lod scores (n=54) were 1.3, 1.6, 2.7, and 2.2
      and affected relative pairs P values (n=54) were .04, .03, .14, and .04
      for D12S373, D12S1057, D12S1042, and D12S390, respectively. Sibpair
      analysis (n=54) resulted in maximum lod scores (MLSs) of 1.5, 2.6, 3.2,
      and 2.3 for these markers, with a peak multipoint MLS of 3.5. A priori
      stratification by APOE genotype identified 27 families that had at least 1
      member with AD whose genotype did not contain an APOE*4 allele. Analysis
      of these 27 families resulted in MLSs of 1.0, 2.4, 3.7, and 3.3 and a peak
      multipoint MLS of 3.9. CONCLUSIONS: A complete genomic screen in families
      affected with late-onset AD identified 4 regions of interest after
      follow-up. Chromosome 12 gave the strongest and most consistent results
      with a peak multipoint MLS of 3.5, suggesting that this region contains a
      new susceptibility gene for AD. Additional analyses are necessary to
      identify the chromosome 12 susceptibility gene for AD and to follow up the
      regions of interest on chromosomes 4, 6, and 20

      Evidence for association of HLA-A2 allele with onset age of Alzheimer's
      disease
    journal: Neurology

    pages: 512-8
    abstract: >-
      Our earlier studies had suggested a possible association between the
      HLA-A2 allele and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study we tested
      the hypothesis that A2 is associated with earlier AD onset. We performed
      two independent studies: a collaborative study with 111 patients and a
      confirmatory study with 96 patients. We found similar patterns of reduced
      age at onset as a function of A2 in both data sets. Overall, A2 was
      associated with a significant 3-year shift to earlier onset. The effects
      of A2 and epsilon 4 on age at onset appeared additive. Our results suggest
      A2, or a closely linked gene, modulates onset age of AD. Association with
      A2 would suggest an immune/inflammatory response mechanism for AD.

    abstract: >-
      An autosomal dominant presenile dementia affecting 39 individuals in a
      seven-generation, 383-member pedigree has been studied at Indiana
      University. In the affected members of this family, clinical symptoms
      occurred early in life, with an average age at onset of 48.8 years. The
      presenting clinical features include disequilibrium, neck stiffness,
      dysphagia, and memory loss. As the disease progresses, further cognitive
      decline, superior-gaze palsy, and dystaxia also are observed. The average
      duration from onset of symptoms to death is approximately 10 years.
      Neuropathologic studies of nine affected individuals showed neuronal loss
      in several areas of the CNS, as well as argentophilic tau-immunopositive
      inclusions in neurons and in oligodendroglia. A limited genomic screen by
      use of DNA samples from 28 family members localized the gene for this
      disorder to a 3-cM region on chromosome 17, between the markers THRA1 and
      D17S791. The gene for tau also was analyzed, through samples from the
      family

      OBJECTIVE: To examine more closely the association between apolipoprotein
      E (APOE) genotype and Alzheimer disease (AD) by age and sex in populations
      of various ethnic and racial denominations. DATA SOURCES: Forty research
      teams contributed data on APOE genotype, sex, age at disease onset, and
      ethnic background for 5930 patients who met criteria for probable or
      definite AD and 8607 controls without dementia who were recruited from
      clinical, community, and brain bank sources. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds
      ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for AD, adjusted for age
      and study and stratified by major ethnic group (Caucasian, African
      American, Hispanic, and Japanese) and source, were computed for APOE
      genotypes epsilon2/epsilon2, epsilon2/epsilon3, epsilon2/epsilon4,
      epsilon3/epsilon4, and epsilon4/epsilon4 relative to the epsilon3/epsilon3
      group. The influence of age and sex on the OR for each genotype was
      assessed using logistic regression procedures. RESULTS: Among Caucasian
      subjects from clinic- or autopsy-based studies, the risk of AD was
      significantly increased for people with genotypes epsilon2/epsilon4
      (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.6-4.0), epsilon3/epsilon4 (OR=3.2, 95% CI=2.8-3.8), and
      epsilon4/epsilon4 (OR=14.9, 95% CI= 10.8-20.6); whereas, the ORs were
      decreased for people with genotypes epsilon2/epsilon2 (OR=0.6, 95%
      CI=0.2-2.0) and epsilon2/epsilon3 (OR=0.6, 95% CI=0.5-0.8). The APOE
      epsilon4-AD association was weaker among African Americans and Hispanics,
      but there was significant heterogeneity in ORs among studies of African
      Americans (P&#60;.03). The APOE epsilon4-AD association in Japanese
      subjects was stronger than in Caucasian subjects (epsilon3/epsilon4:
      OR=5.6, 95% CI=3.9-8.0; epsilon4/epsilon4: OR=33.1, 95% CI=13.6-80.5). The
      epsilon2/epsilon3 genotype appears equally protective across ethnic
      groups. We also found that among Caucasians, APOE genotype distributions
      are similar in groups of patients with AD whose diagnoses were determined
      clinically or by autopsy. In addition, we found that the APOE epsilon4
      effect is evident at all ages between 40 and 90 years but diminishes after
      age 70 years and that the risk of AD associated with a given genotype
      varies with sex. CONCLUSIONS: The APOE epsilon4 allele represents a major
      risk factor for AD in all ethnic groups studied, across all ages between
      40 and 90 years, and in both men and women. The association between APOE
      epsilon4 and AD in African Americans requires clarification, and the
      attenuated effect of APOE epsilon4 in Hispanics should be investigated
      further

      Polymorphisms in the human apolipoprotein-J/clusterin gene: ethnic
      variation and distribution in Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Hum.Genet.
    volume: 98
    issue: 4
    pages: 430-436
    abstract: >-
      Apolipoprotein-J/clusterin (APOJ/CLI) shares many biological properties
      with apolipoprotein-E (APOE) including, but not limited to, avid binding
      with beta-amyloid peptide. Thus, APOJ/CLI warrants scrutiny as a candidate
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility gene. We identified seven
      nucleotide sequence polymorphisms in APOJ/ CLI, two of which, in exon 7,
      after the predicted amino acid sequence. The JVIIB variant is an
      asparagine-to-histidine substitution, which deletes a glycosylation signal
      at amino acid 317; the JVIIC variant is an aspartate-to-asparagine
      substitution, which forms a new glycosylation signal at position 328. Both
      of these coding variants, as well as two neutral polymorphisms in exon 2,
      were more frequent in African-Americans than Hispanics and were rare in
      Caucasians. However, no individual coding or noncoding variant was
      consistently associated with AD. At the population level, APOJ/CLI
      polymorphisms are frequent among persons of African descent, but probably
      do not alter susceptibility to AD

      No association between very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL-R) and

    abstract: >-
      The very low density lipoprotein receptor gene (VLDL-R) is a receptor for
      apolipoprotein-epsilon (APOE)-containing lipoproteins, and thus has been
      suggested as a possible risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Recently,
      Okuizumi et al. [Nature Genet, II (1995) 207-209] reported an association
      between the 96 bp allele at the VLDL-R locus and AD in a Japanese
      population. The association resulted in a two-fold increase of risk that
      decreased with increasing age. We have examined this association in 316
      Caucasian sporadic AD patients, comparing their findings to 160 Caucasian
      AD spouse controls. We also investigated 53 late-onset Caucasian AD
      families for association and linkage. Our data failed to confirm linkage
      and/or association to the VLDL-R locus. Stratification by age at onset or
      APOE genotype also failed to show significant results

      Gender difference in apolipoprotein E-associated risk for familial

    volume: 58

    pages: 803-811
    abstract: >-
      Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with the apolipoprotein E
      (APOE)-epsilon4 allele. In late-onset familial AD, women have a
      significantly higher risk of developing the disease than do men. The aim
      of this study was to determine whether the gender difference in familial
      AD is a function of APOE genotype. We studied 58 late-onset familial AD
      kindreds. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess
      genotype-specific distributions of age at onset. Odds ratios were
      estimated by logistic regression with adjustment for age and by
      conditional logistic regression with stratification on families. All
      methods detected a significant gender difference for the epsilon4
      heterozygous genotype. In women, epsilon4 heterozygotes had higher risk
      than those without epsilon4; there was no significant difference between
      epsilon4 heterozygotes and epsilon4 homozygotes. In men, epsilon4
      heterozygotes had lower risk than epsilon4 homozygotes; there was not
      significant difference between epsilon4 heterozygotes and those without
      epsilon4. A direct comparison of epsilon4 heterozygous men and women
      revealed a significant twofold increased risk in women. We confirmed these
      results in 15 autopsy-confirmed AD kindreds from the National Cell
      Repository at Indiana University Alzheimer Disease Center. These
      observations are consistent with the increased incidence of familial AD in
      women and may be a critical clue to the role of gender in the pathogenesis
      of AD

      The role of gender in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an
      important issue that remains controversial. We compared men and women in
      late-onset familial AD kindreds for the risk of developing AD by studying
      26 well-characterized familial AD kindreds from the Oregon Alzheimer
      Disease Center and, for confirmation, an additional 32 kindreds from the
      National Cell Repository (NCR) at the Indiana University Alzheimer Disease
      Center. Comparing women to men, the age-adjusted odds ratio estimates were
      3.2 (p = 0.0002) for the Oregon data and 2.3 (p = 0.004) for the NCR data.
      These results suggest that gender is an independent risk factor for
      familial late-onset AD and may play a role in the pathogenesis of this
      disease

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder for
      individuals over the age of 40. AD has a complex etiology, and it is
      likely that multiple genes, acting independently and/or interacting,
      affect the risk of developing AD. Several genes involved with AD have been
      described already, but only the APOE gene on chromosome 19q has been shown
      to affect the risk of the common late onset form of AD.
      alpha1-Antichymotrypsin (AACT) is a major component of the amyloid plaques
      found in the brains of AD patients, and an allele in its gene has been
      proposed to increase the risk of developing AD when also associated with
      the APOE-4 allele. We have examined the role of this AACT polymorphism in
      a large set of families and sporadic cases, and do not see any effect,
      either alone or in combination with the APOE-4 allele

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common mid to late age-of-onset
      neurodegenerative disorder. AD has a strong and complex genetic etiology,
      and multiple genes, acting independently and/or interacting, likely affect
      the risk of developing AD. Several genes involved with AD already have
      been described, but only the APOE gene on chromosome 19q has been shown to
      affect the risk of the most common form of AD, occurring with onset over
      the age of 65. Because a substantial portion of late-onset AD is not
      explained by APOE, other genes affecting late-onset AD likely occur. These
      could act either independently or perhaps interact with APOE. alpha
      1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) is a major component of the amyloid plaques found
      in the brains of AD patients and may play a role in the pathophysiology of
      AD. It has been proposed that a specific polymorphism within the ACT gene
      interacts with APOE to increase the risk of developing AD. Our results do
      not confirm this finding

      OBJECTIVE: Cerebral parietal hypometabolism and left-right asymmetry occur
      early in the course of Alzheimer disease (AD), and the apolipoprotein E
      type 4 allele (APOE epsilon 4) is a risk factor for familial AD. To
      determine if APOE epsilon 4 is associated with lowered brain function in
      nondemented relatives at risk for familial AD, we studied 12 relatives
      with APOE epsilon 4 and 19 relatives without APOE epsilon 4. We also
      compared them with seven patients with probable AD. DESIGN: After grouping
      subjects according to diagnosis and genotype, brain function measures were
      compared among groups. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: At
      risk subjects had mild memory complaints, normal cognitive performance,
      and at least two relatives with AD. Subjects with APOE epsilon 4 did not
      differ from those without APOE epsilon 4 in mean age at examination (56.4
      vs 55.5 years) or in neuropsychological performance (mean Mini-Mental
      State Examination score, 28.8 vs 29.3). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cerebral
      glucose metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography and
      fludeoxyglucose F 18. RESULTS: Parietal metabolism was significantly lower
      and left-right parietal asymmetry was significantly higher in at-risk
      subjects with APOE epsilon 4 compared with those without APOE epsilon 4.
      Patients with dementia had significantly lower parietal metabolism than
      did at-risk subjects with APOE epsilon 4. CONCLUSIONS: These results
      suggest that the inheritance of APOE epsilon 4 is associated with reduced
      cerebral parietal metabolism and increased asymmetry in non-demented
      relatives at risk for probable AD. Longitudinal study will determine if
      glucose metabolic measures provide a means to monitor experimental
      treatment responses during the early phases of the disorder

      Influence of the susceptibility genes apolipoprotein E-epsilon 4 and

      late-onset Alzheimer's disease
    journal: Arzneimittelforschung

    abstract: >-
      Apolipoprotein E-epsilon 4 (APOE4, gene; apoE4, protein) is a
      susceptibility gene or risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The genetic
      relevance of APOE4 has been widely confirmed. The APOE gene is not a
      disease locus, with specific mutations causing Alzheimer disease. Allelic
      variations at the APOE locus affect the rate of disease progression. The
      association of specific inherited APOE alleles with age of onset
      distributions describes biological effects based on genotype. The
      inheritance of polymorphic genes with single amino acid differences
      between apoE4 and apoE3 (and between apoE3 and apoE2) at the protein level
      is associated with differences in the mean age of disease onset spanning
      almost two decades. The isoform-specific metabolism of apoE resulting in a
      faster rate of disease expression can now be studied with the expectation
      that genetically relevant processes are being investigated. There is now
      an opportunity to develop theories directed at the genetically relevant
      apoE metabolism that can significantly delay disease expression.

      Familial Alzheimer's disease in kindreds with missense mutations in a gene

    abstract: >-
      We report the cloning of a novel gene (E5-1) encoded on chromosome 1 which
      has substantial nucleotide and amino-acid sequence similarity to the S182
      gene on chromosome 14q24.3. Mutations, including three new missense
      mutations in the S182 gene, are associated with the AD3 subtype of
      early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both the E5-1 and the S182
      proteins are predicted to be integral membrane proteins with seven
      membrane-spanning domains, and a large exposed loop between the sixth and
      seventh transmembrane domains. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the
      open reading frame (ORF) of the E5-1 gene led to the discovery of two
      missense substitutions at conserved amino-acid residues in affected
      members of pedigrees with a form of familial AD that has a later age of
      onset than the AD3 subtype (50-70 years versus 30-60 years for AD3). These
      observations imply that the E5-1 gene on chromosome 1 and the S182 gene on
      chromosome 14q24.3 are members of a family of genes (presenilins) with
      related functions, and indicates that mutations in conserved residues of
      E5-1 could also play a role in the genesis of AD. Our results also
      indicate that still other AD susceptibility genes exist

    abstract: >-
      The E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene has been identified as a
      risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Immediately downstream from the APOE
      gene on chromosome 19 is the gene for apolipoprotein CI (APOCI). We have
      found that the frequency of an APOCI restriction site is 0.45 for
      Alzheimer's patients and 0.14 for control spouses, which is similar to the
      frequencies for the APOE4 allele. The APOE4 allele is in linkage
      disequilibrium with the APOCI restriction site. Thus both the APOE4 allele
      and the APOCI restriction site may be considered as risk factors for
      Alzheimer's disease

      An increased frequency of the apolipoprotein E type 4 allele (APOE-4) has
      previously been associated with both late-onset sporadic and late-onset
      familial Alzheimer disease (AD) [Strittmatter et al. (1993) Proc Natl Acad
      Sci USA 90:1977-1981; Saunders et al. (1993a) Neurology 43:1467-1472]. To
      further investigate this association we genotyped affected individuals
      from 92 separate AD pedigrees including both early- and late-onset cases.
      An increased frequency of the APOE-4 allele was found only among the
      late-onset cases, both familial and sporadic, confirming the earlier
      reports. In addition, age at onset was significantly decreased in the
      APOE-4 homozygotes (in late onset families) compared to either APOE-4
      heterozygotes or individuals not carrying an APOE-4 allele. We also
      observed a significantly decreased frequency of the APOE-2 allele in both
      the early- and late-onset familial cases. These results strengthen the
      argument for a direct role of APOE in susceptibility to AD

      Apolipoprotein E genotype in patients with Alzheimer's disease:
      implications for the risk of dementia among relatives
    journal: Ann.Neurol.
    volume: 38
    issue: 5
    pages: 797-808
    abstract: >-
      Numerous studies have shown that the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is
      associated with the dose of the epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E
      (ApoE). However, more than one third of AD patients lack epsilon 4 and
      many persons having epsilon 4 survive cognitively intact to old age. We
      evaluated the lifetime risk of disease in 3,999 first-degree relatives of
      549 probands who met the criteria for probable or definite AD and whose
      ApoE genotypes were known. ApoE genotypes for relatives were not
      determined. After age 65 the risk among relatives was proportional, as
      much as 7 to 10% at age 85, to the number of epsilon 4 alleles present in
      the proband. Risks to relatives of ApoE 2/2 and 2/3 probands were nearly
      identical at all ages to risks for relatives of ApoE 3/3 probands. The
      expected proportion of relatives having at least one epsilon 4 allele was
      calculated for each genotype group based on the distribution of parents,
      sibs, and offspring in the sample. Among relatives in the ApoE 3/3 group,
      the lifetime risk for AD by age 90 was three times greater than the
      expected proportion of epsilon 4 carriers, suggesting that factors other
      than ApoE contribute to AD susceptibility. Furthermore, the 44% risk of AD
      by age 93 among relatives of ApoE 4/4 probands indicates that as many as
      50% of people having at least one epsilon 4 allele do not develop AD. We
      also found that among male relatives, risk of AD in the ApoE 3/4 group was
      similar to that for the ApoE 3/3 group but significantly less than the
      risk for the ApoE 4/4 group. In contrast, among female relatives the risk
      for the ApoE 3/4 group was nearly twice that for the ApoE 3/3 group and
      identical to the risk for the ApoE 4/4 group. These findings are
      consistent with a sex-modification effect of the E4 isoform on disease
      susceptibility

      Apolipoprotein E, survival in Alzheimer's disease patients, and the

    journal: Neurology
    volume: 45
    issue: 7
    pages: 1323-8
    abstract: >-
      The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele carries an increased risk of
      a patient developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) while the epsilon 2 allele
      carries a decreased risk. We compared survival from the onset of AD in
      subjects with different numbers of epsilon 4 alleles and evaluated changes
      in genotypic frequencies with age. Two subject groups were investigated:
      unrelated AD case and control subjects, and affected and unaffected
      members from 74 multiplex AD families. In both subject groups, survival
      from onset decreased with increasing onset age, was longer in women, and
      was unrelated to epsilon 4 gene dose. The epsilon 2/epsilon 3 genotype
      became more common with age (p = 0.004). The epsilon 4 allele decreased in
      frequency with age in all patient groups but, unexpectedly, remained
      unchanged in control subjects. We conclude that the progression of AD is
      not strongly related to epsilon 4 gene dose, that the higher prevalence of
      AD in women may involve the longer survival of affected women, and that AD
      and death are competing risks involving APOE that change over time.

    pages: 631-42
    abstract: >-
      The chromosome 19 apolipoprotein E/CI/CII gene cluster was examined for
      evidence of linkage to a familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) locus. The
      family groups studied were Volga German (VG), early-onset non-VG (ENVG;
      mean age at onset &#60; 60 years), and late-onset families. A genetic
      association was observed between apolipoprotein E (ApoE) allele epsilon 4
      and FAD in late-onset families; the epsilon 4 allele frequency was .51 in
      affected subjects, .37 in at-risk subjects, .11 in spouses, and .19 in
      unrelated controls. The differences between the epsilon 4 frequencies in
      affected subjects versus controls and in at-risk subjects versus controls
      were highly significant (standard normal deviate [ZSND]) = 7.37, P &#60;
      10(-9); and ZSND = 4.07, P &#60; .00005, respectively). No association
      between the epsilon 4 allele and FAD was observed in the ENVG or VG
      groups. A statistically significant allelic association between epsilon 4
      and AD was also observed in a group of unrelated subjects; the epsilon 4
      frequency was .26 in affected subjects, versus .19 in controls (ZSND =
      2.20, P &#60; .03). Evidence of linkage of ApoE and ApoCII to FAD was
      examined by maximum-likelihood methods, using three models and assuming
      autosomal dominant inheritance: (1) age-dependent penetrance, (2)
      extremely low (1%) penetrance, and (3) age-dependent penetrance corrected
      for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). For ApoCII in late-onset families,
      results for close linkage were negative, and only small positive
      lod-score-statistic (Z) values were obtained (model 1, maximum Z[Zmax] =
      0.61, recombination fraction [theta] = .30; model 2, Zmax = 0.47, theta =
      .20). For ApoE in late-onset kindreds, positive Z values were obtained
      when either allele frequencies from controls (model 1, Zmax = 2.02, theta
      = .15; model 2, Zmax = 3.42, theta = .05) or allele frequencies from the
      families (model 1, Zmax = 1.43, theta = .15; model 2, Zmax = 1.70, theta =
      .05) were used. When linkage disequilibrium was incorporated into the
      analysis, the Z values increased (model 1, Zmax = 3.17, theta = .23; model
      3, Zmax = 1.85, theta = .20). For the ENVG group, results for ApoE and
      ApoCII were uniformly negative. Affected-pedigree-member analysis gave
      significant results for the late-onset kindreds, for ApoE (ZSND = 3.003, P
      = .003) and ApoCII (ZSND = 2.319, P = .016), when control allele
      frequencies were used but not when allele frequencies were derived from
      the families.

      origin with late-onset Alzheimer's disease and in unaffected control
      subjects from the same ethnic group. A significant association was

      Increasing evidence suggests that proteases and their inhibitors play an
      important role in the etiology of beta-amyloidogenesis and Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). It is not clear, however, which proteases and protease
      inhibitors are responsible for the amyloidogenic proteolysis. Candidates
      include alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor, and forms
      of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta PP) bearing Kunitz protease
      inhibitor domains. As one approach to this question, we have determined
      the trypsin inhibitor activity of fibroblast-like cells from 10 familial
      AD subjects and 20 controls. The activity was quantitated by measuring
      remaining trypsin activity of reaction mixtures containing trypsin and
      cell lysates using a fluorogenic substrate and two physiologically
      distinct populations of fibroblasts: proliferating cells (grown in the
      presence of 16% serum) and quiescent cells (maintained in 0.1% serum). The
      remaining trypsin activities of crude protein extracts from proliferating
      and quiescent AD cultures were not significantly different from those of
      controls. Perhaps of more general interest to the biology of aging,
      however, was our finding that protease inhibitor activity increased with
      the age of the donor (p = 0.005)

      Clinical characteristics in a kindred with early-onset Alzheimer's disease

    abstract: >-
      Patients from five generations of a family developed presenile Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) early in the fifth decade. Recent memory,
      information-processing speed, sequential tracking, and conceptual
      reasoning were the earliest cognitive functions affected. Language and
      visuoperceptual skills were largely spared early in the course of the
      disease. Later, there were progressive cognitive deficits and inability to
      perform the activities of daily living. Death occurred, on average, 6
      years after onset. Three autopsies in affected members revealed cerebral
      amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Clinical and pathologic
      features were typical for familial AD. Direct DNA sequencing revealed a
      G--&#62;T change at position 2149 of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)
      gene that resulted in the substitution of phenylalanine for valine in the
      transmembrane domain of the mature protein. This mutation was present in
      DNA from all four examined affected individuals and linked to the disease
      with a lod score of 3.25, and was the most probable cause of AD in this
      family.

      Protective effect of apolipoprotein E type 2 allele for late onset

    abstract: >-
      Gene dosage of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele is a major
      risk factor for familial Alzheimer disease (AD) of late onset (after age
      60). Here we studied a large series of 115 AD case subjects and 243
      controls as well as 150 affected and 197 unaffected members of 66 AD
      families. Our data demonstrate a protective effect of the epsilon 2
      allele, in addition to the dose effect of the epsilon 4 allele in sporadic
      AD. Although a substantial proportion (65%) of AD is attributable to the
      presence of epsilon 4 alleles, risk of AD is lowest in subjects with the
      epsilon 2/epsilon 3 genotype, with an additional 23% of AD attributable to
      the absence of an epsilon 2 allele. The opposite actions of the epsilon 2
      and epsilon 4 alleles further support the direct involvement of APOE in
      the pathogenesis of AD

    abstract: >-
      Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) has been shown to be associated with
      three distinct point mutations within the same codon of the amyloid
      precursor protein (APP) gene. The mutation identified in the Indiana
      kindred is a G--&#62;T transversion at the first position of the codon for
      amino acid 717, resulting in a substitution of phenylalanine for valine in
      the APP protein. Screening of persons at risk for the APP Phe-717 mutation
      using a variation of the polymerase chain reaction identified nine
      positives among 34 tested. In addition, DNA from 145 FAD subjects were
      tested for the three known APP 717 mutations.

    pages: 619-628
    abstract: >-
      Familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) is genetically heterogeneous. Two loci
      responsible for early-onset FAD have been identified: the amyloid
      precursor protein gene on chromosome 21 and the as-yet-unidentified locus
      on chromosome 14. The genetics of late-onset FAD is unresolved.
      Maximum-likelihood, affected-pedigree-member (APM), and sib-pair analyses
      were used, in 49 families with a mean age at onset &#62; or = 60 years, to
      determine whether the chromosome 14 locus is responsible for late-onset
      FAD. The markers used were D14S53, D14S43, and D14S52. The LOD score
      method was used to test for linkage of late-onset FAD to the chromosome 14
      markers, under three different models: age-dependent penetrance, an
      affected-only analysis, and age-dependent penetrance with allowance for
      possible age-dependent sporadic cases. No evidence for linkage was
      obtained under any of these conditions for the late-onset kindreds, and
      strong evidence against linkage (LOD score &#60; or = -2.0) to this region
      was obtained. Heterogeneity tests of the LOD score results for the
      combined group of families (early onset, Volga Germans, and late onset)
      favored the hypothesis of linkage to chromosome 14 with genetic
      heterogeneity. The positive results are primarily from early-onset
      families. APM analysis gave significant evidence for linkage of D14S43 and
      D14S52 to FAD in early-onset kindreds (P &#60; .02). No evidence for
      linkage was found for the entire late-onset family group. Significant
      evidence for linkage to D14S52, however, was found for a subgroup of
      families of intermediate age at onset (mean age at onset &#62; or = 60
      years and &#60; 70 years). These results indicate that the chromosome 14
      locus is not responsible for Alzheimer disease in most late-onset FAD
      kindreds but could play a role in a subset of these kindreds

      The frequency of the allele for apolipoprotein E type 4 (epsilon 4) is
      increased in late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). We
      have examined epsilon 4 frequencies in four distinct, normal, elderly
      control groups and, most importantly, in patients with amyloid-forming
      diseases whose epsilon 4 distributions were not previously known
      (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, Down's
      syndrome). There were no differences between any of these controls and
      published control series, cementing the relevance of epsilon 4 for
      late-onset AD. The increase in late-onset AD was confirmed in two new
      series.

      Lack of detectable radiation hypersensitivity in lymphoblastoid cells from

    journal: Alzheimer Dis.Assoc.Disord.

    issue: 2

    abstract: >-
      Recent reports suggest that cultivated nonneuronal cells from individuals
      with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other specific hereditary
      neurodegenerative disorders show hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents
      such as x-rays and radiomimetic chemicals. The hypothesis proposed is that
      a number of chronic neurologic degenerations, including AD, may be the
      result of accumulation of damaged DNA, resulting from a defect in DNA
      repair. We investigated this hypothesis by evaluating cells from
      individuals from pedigrees of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) for
      hypersensitivity to x-irradiation. Sensitivity was assayed by viability
      measured by trypan blue dye exclusion and micronucleus formation. We
      tested B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from nine patients and nine unaffected
      family members from pedigrees with FAD, three unrelated controls, three
      ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients, and three Down syndrome individuals.
      The AT cell lines showed the expected reduced viability and increased
      micronucleus formation after x-ray treatment. The FAD and control lines
      showed marked heterogeneity with both assays. There was no significant
      differences between the FAD patients and controls. The wide variability in
      the response of cell lines from controls and patients indicates the need
      for more sensitive assays for detection of radiation sensitivity in cells
      from various neurologic disorders

      We studied neuropathologically 3 patients of a previously unreported
      kindred of presenile Alzheimer disease (AD), characterized by a G to T
      mutation at base pair 1924 (695 transcript) of the amyloid precursor
      protein gene. Classic features of presenile AD are observed.
      Neurofibrillary tangles with paired helical filaments as well as neuritic
      plaques are found in large number in neocortex and hippocampus.
      beta-Protein deposits in meningeal and parenchymal vessels are present,
      but not severe. Prominent subpial ribbon-like deposits are detected with
      antibodies to a 28-residue synthetic peptide; however, only occasionally
      can they be seen in thioflavin S treated sections. Along with a mild
      involvement of vessels, as demonstrated by beta-protein immunolabeling,
      parenchymal involvement is also seen in the cerebellar molecular layer. In
      the course of the study, we have not detected neuropathologic changes,
      which are mutation specific. Further investigations of familial Alzheimer
      disease with known genetic mutations will clarify whether correlations
      exist between specific mutations and neuropathologic phenotypes

    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease is a form of localized amyloidosis characterized by
      cerebral cortical amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid
      deposits within the walls of leptomeningeal vessels. Although most cases
      of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, kindreds with autosomal-dominant
      inheritance of the syndrome suggest that a single mutation may be
      important in pathogenesis. Direct sequencing of DNA from a family with
      autopsy-proven Alzheimer's disease revealed a single amino acid
      substitution (Phe for Val) in the transmembrane domain of the amyloid
      precursor protein. This mutation correlates with the presence of
      Alzheimer's disease in all patients in this study, and may be the
      inherited factor causing both amyloid fibril formation and dementia

      Novel genetic loci underlying human intracranial volume identified through

    abstract: >-
      Intracranial volume reflects the maximally attained brain size during
      development, and remains stable with loss of tissue in late life. It is
      highly heritable, but the underlying genes remain largely undetermined. In
      a genome-wide association study of 32,438 adults, we discovered five
      previously unknown loci for intracranial volume and confirmed two known
      signals. Four of the loci were also associated with adult humanstature,
      but these remained associated with intracranial volume after adjusting for
      height. We found a high genetic correlation with child head circumference
      (ρgenetic = 0.748), which indicates a similar genetic background and
      allowed us to identify four additional loci through meta-analysis
      (Ncombined = 37,345). Variants for intracranial volume were also related
      to childhood and adult cognitive function, and Parkinson's disease, and
      were enriched near genes involved in growth pathways, including PI3K-AKT
      signaling. These findings identify the biological underpinnings of
      intracranial volume and their link to physiological and pathological
      traits.

      Linkage analyses in Caribbean Hispanic families identify novel loci
      associated with familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease

      INTRODUCTION:

      We performed linkage analyses in Caribbean Hispanic families with multiple
      late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) cases to identify regions that may
      contain disease causative variants.

      METHODS:

      We selected 67 LOAD families to perform genome-wide linkage scan. Analysis
      of the linked regions was repeated using the entire sample of 282
      families. Validated chromosomal regions were analyzed using joint linkage
      and association.

      RESULTS:

      We identified 26 regions linked to LOAD (HLOD ≥3.6). We validated 13 of
      the regions (HLOD ≥2.5) using the entire family sample. The strongest
      signal was at 11q12.3 (rs2232932: HLODmax = 4.7, Pjoint = 6.6 × 10(-6)), a
      locus located ∼2 Mb upstream of the membrane-spanning 4A gene cluster. We
      additionally identified a locus at 7p14.3 (rs10255835: HLODmax = 4.9,
      Pjoint = 1.2 × 10(-5)), a regionharboring genes associated with the
      nervous system (GARS, GHRHR, and NEUROD6).

      DISCUSSION:

      Future sequencing efforts should focus on these regions because they may
      harbor familial LOAD causative mutations.

      Genetic variants associated with susceptibility to psychosis in late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease families
    journal: "Neurobiol Aging "

    abstract: >-
      Psychotic symptoms are frequent in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD)
      patients. Although the risk for psychosis in LOAD is genetically mediated,
      no genes have been identified. To identify loci potentially containing
      genetic variants associated with risk of psychosis in LOAD, a total of 263
      families from the National Institute of Aging-LOAD cohort were classified
      into psychotic (LOAD+P, n = 215) and nonpsychotic (LOAD-P, n = 48)
      families based on the presence/absence of psychosis during the course of
      LOAD. The LOAD+P families yielded strong evidence of linkage on chromosome
      19q13 (two-point [2-pt] ​logarithm of odds [LOD] = 3.8, rs2285513 and
      multipoint LOD = 2.7, rs541169). Joint linkage and association in 19q13
      region detected strong association with rs2945988 (p = 8.7 × 10(-7)).
      Linkage results for the LOAD-P families yielded nonsignificant 19q13 LOD
      scores. Several 19q13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms generalized the
      association of LOAD+P in a Caribbean Hispanic (CH) cohort, and the
      strongest signal was rs10410711 (pmeta = 5.1 × 10(-5)). A variant located
      24 kb upstream of rs10410711 and rs10421862 was strongly associated with
      LOAD+P (pmeta = 1.0 × 10(-5)) in a meta-analysis of the CH cohort and an
      additional non-Hispanic Caucasian dataset. Identified variants rs2945988
      and rs10421862 affect brain gene expression levels. Our results suggest
      that genetic variants in genes on 19q13, some of which are involved in
      brain development and neurodegeneration, may influence the susceptibility
      to psychosis in LOAD patients.

      OBJECTIVE: The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest known
      common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and alters age of
      onset in retrospective studies. Here, we longitudinally test the effects
      of APOE ε4 genotype and age during progression from normal cognition to
      AD.

      METHODS:

      Using data from 5381 cognitively normal older individuals and Cox
      proportional hazards models, we longitudinally tested the effects of APOE
      genotype on progression from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) or AD in four age strata (&lt;60, 60-70, 70-80, 80 + ) and with a
      sliding window approach between ages 60 and 85.

      RESULTS:

      We found that APOE ε4 carrier status and dosage significantly influenced
      progression to MCI or AD in all four age groups and that APOE
      ε4-associated progression risk peaked between ages 70 and 75. We confirmed
      APOE ε4-associated progression risk in a subset of the cohort with
      pathologically proven diagnoses.

      INTERPRETATION:

      Our findings indicate that in clinically normal individuals, APOE ε4
      status significantly predicts progression to MCI or AD across older
      adulthood and that this risk varies with age. This information will be
      useful as therapeutic interventions become available and clinical
      decisions can be individually tailored based on age and genetic data.

      Genome-wide, high-content siRNA screening identifies the Alzheimer's
      genetic risk factor FERMT2 as a major modulator of APP metabolism
    journal: Acta Neuropathol.
    abstract: >-
      Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified 19 susceptibility
      loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, understanding how these genes
      are involved in the pathophysiology of AD is one of the main challenges of
      the "post-GWAS" era. At least 123 genes are located within the 19
      susceptibility loci; hence, a conventional approach (studying the genes
      one by one) would not be time- and cost-effective. We therefore developed
      a genome-wide, high-content siRNA screening approach and used it to assess
      the functional impact of gene under-expression on APP metabolism. We found
      that 832 genes modulated APP metabolism. Eight of these genes were located
      within AD susceptibility loci. Only FERMT2 (a β3-integrin co-activator)
      was also significantly associated with a variation in cerebrospinal fluid
      Aβ peptide levels in 2886 AD cases. Lastly, we showed that the
      under-expression of FERMT2 increases Aβ peptide production by raising
      levels of mature APP at the cell surface and facilitating its recycling.
      Taken as a whole, our data suggest that FERMT2 modulates the AD risk by
      regulating APP metabolism and Aβ peptide production.

      "Inflammatory Biomarkers Predict Domain-Specific Cognitive Decline in
      Older Adults."
    journal: " J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci."
    abstract: >-
      Vascular risk factors, including inflammation, may contribute to dementia
      development. We investigated the associations between peripheral
      inflammatory biomarkers and cognitive decline in five domains (memory,
      construction, language, psychomotor speed, and executive function).

      METHODS:

      Community-dwelling older adults from the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study
      (n = 1,159, aged 75 or older) free of dementia at baseline were included
      and followed for up to 7 years. Ten biomarkers were measured at baseline
      representing different sources of inflammation: vascular inflammation
      (pentraxin 3 and serum amyloid P), endothelial function (endothelin-1),
      metabolic function (adiponectin, resistin, and plasminogen activating
      inhibitor-1), oxidative stress (receptor for advanced glycation end
      products), and general inflammation (interleukin-6, interleukin-2, and
      interleukin-10). A combined z-score was created from these biomarkers to
      represent total inflammation across these sources. We utilized generalized
      estimating equations that included an interaction term between z-scores
      and time to assess effect of inflammation on cognitive decline, adjusting
      for demographics (such as age, race/ethnicity, and sex), cardiovascular
      risk factors, and apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier status. A
      Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of .01 was used. We explored
      associations between individual biomarkers and cognitive decline without
      adjustment for multiplicity.

      RESULTS:

      The combined inflammation z-score was significantly associated with memory
      and psychomotor speed (p &lt; .01). Pentraxin 3, serum amyloid P,
      endothelin-1, and interleukin-2 were associated with change in at least
      one cognitive domain (p &lt; .05).

      CONCLUSION:

      Our results suggest that total inflammation is associated with memory and
      psychomotor speed. In particular, systemic inflammation, vascular
      inflammation, and altered endothelial function may play roles in
      domain-specific cognitive decline of nondemented individuals.

      "Evaluation of a Genetic Risk Score to Improve Risk Prediction for
      Alzheimer's Disease.
    journal: " J Alzheimers Dis "
    volume: 53
    issue: 3
    pages: 921-932
    abstract: >-
      Effective prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires the development
      of risk prediction tools permitting preclinical intervention. We
      constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising common genetic variants
      associated with AD, evaluated its association with incident AD and
      assessed its capacity to improve risk prediction over traditional models
      based on age, sex, education, and APOEɛ4. In eight prospective cohorts
      included in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), we
      derived weighted sum of risk alleles from the 19 top SNPs reported by the
      IGAP GWAS in participants aged 65 and older without prevalent dementia.
      Hazard ratios (HR) of incident AD were estimated in Cox models.
      Improvement in risk prediction was measured by the difference in C-index
      (Δ-C), the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net
      reclassification improvement (NRI>0). Overall, 19,687 participants at risk
      were included, of whom 2,782 developed AD. The GRS was associated with a
      17% increase in AD risk (pooled HR = 1.17; 95% CI =   [1.13-1.21] per
      standard deviation increase in GRS; p-value =  2.86×10-16). This
      association was stronger among persons with at least one APOEɛ4 allele
      (HRGRS = 1.24; 95% CI =   [1.15-1.34]) than in others (HRGRS = 1.13; 95%
      CI =   [1.08-1.18]; pinteraction = 3.45×10-2). Risk prediction after seven
      years of follow-up showed a small improvement when adding the GRS to age,
      sex, APOEɛ4, and education (Δ-Cindex =  0.0043 [0.0019-0.0067]). Similar
      patterns were observed for IDI and NRI>0. In conclusion, a risk score
      incorporating common genetic variation outside the APOEɛ4 locus improved
      AD riskprediction and may facilitate risk stratification for prevention
      trials.

      Cortical Amyloid beta Deposition and Current Depressive Symptoms in
      Alzheimer Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment

    volume: 29
    issue: 3
    pages: 149-159
    abstract: >-
      Depressive symptoms are frequently seen in patients with dementia and mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI). Evidence suggests that there may be a link
      between current depressive symptoms and Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated
      pathological changes, such as an increase in cortical amyloid-β (Aβ).
      However, limited in vivo studies have explored the relationship between
      current depressive symptoms and cortical Aβ in patients with MCI and AD.
      Our study, using a large sample of 455 patients with MCI and 153 patients
      with AD from the Alzheimer's diseaseNeuroimaging Initiatives, investigated
      whether current depressive symptoms are related to cortical Aβ deposition.
      Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale and
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory-depression/dysphoria. Cortical Aβ was
      quantified using positron emission tomography with the Aβ
      probe(18)F-florbetapir (AV-45).(18)F-florbetapir standardized uptake value
      ratio (AV-45 SUVR) from the frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal
      regions was estimated. A global AV-45 SUVR, defined as the average of
      frontal, cingulate, precuneus, and parietal cortex, was also used. We
      observed that current depressive symptoms were not related to cortical Aβ,
      after controlling for potential confounds, including history of major
      depression. We also observed that there was no difference in cortical Aβ
      between matched participants with high and low depressive symptoms, as
      well as no difference between matched participants with the presence and
      absence of depressive symptoms. The association between depression and
      cortical Aβ deposition does not exist, but the relationship is highly
      influenced by stressful events in the past, such as previous depressive
      episodes, and complex interactions of different pathways underlying both
      depression and dementia.

      ABCA7 frameshift deletion associated with Alzheimer disease in African
      Americans.
    journal: "Neurol Genet "
    volume: 2
    issue: 3
    pages: e79
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      To identify a causative variant(s) that may contribute to Alzheimer
      disease (AD) in African Americans (AA) in the ATP-binding cassette,
      subfamily A (ABC1), member 7 (ABCA7) gene, a known risk factor for
      late-onset AD.

      METHODS:

      Custom capture sequencing was performed on ∼150 kb encompassing ABCA7 in
      40 AA cases and 37 AA controls carrying the AA risk allele (rs115550680).
      Association testing was performed for an ABCA7 deletion identified in
      large AA data sets (discovery n = 1,068; replication n = 1,749) and whole
      exome sequencing of Caribbean Hispanic (CH) AD families.

      RESULTS:

      A 44-base pair deletion (rs142076058) was identified in all 77 risk
      genotype carriers, which shows that the deletion is in high linkage
      disequilibrium with the risk allele. The deletion was assessed in a large
      data set (531 cases and 527 controls) and, after adjustments for age, sex,
      and APOE status, was significantly associated with disease (p = 0.0002,
      odds ratio [OR] = 2.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.42-3.20]). An
      independent data set replicated the association (447 cases and 880
      controls, p = 0.0117, OR = 1.65 [95% CI: 1.12-2.44]), and joint analysis
      increased the significance (p = 1.414 × 10(-5), OR = 1.81 [95% CI:
      1.38-2.37]). The deletion is common in AA cases (15.2%) and AA controls
      (9.74%), but in only 0.12% of our non-Hispanic white cohort. Whole exome
      sequencing of multiplex, CH families identified the deletion cosegregating
      with disease in a large sibship. The deleted allele produces a stable,
      detectable RNA strand and is predicted to result in a frameshift mutation
      (p.Arg578Alafs) that could interfere with protein function.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      This common ABCA7 deletion could represent an ethnic-specific pathogenic
      alteration in AD.

      Trajectories of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Cognitive Decline in Mild
      Cognitive Impairment.
    journal: "Am J Geriatr Psychiatry "
    volume: 24
    issue: 1
    pages: 70-80
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      To characterize the course of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in adults
      with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to examine baseline
      individual-level predictors and associated cognitive and functional
      outcomes.

      DESIGN:

      A 2-year prospective cohort study.

      SETTING:

      Multicenter clinical settings.

      PARTICIPANTS:

      Five hundred sixty individuals with MCI at baseline.

      MEASUREMENTS:

      NPS severity (measured using Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire) and
      cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed at baseline and every 6
      months thereafter. Potential individual-level predictors were collected at
      baseline.

      RESULTS:

      Three latent classes of NPS courses were identified using growth mixture
      modeling: a stable class in which a low NPS burden remained relatively
      unchanged over time (N = 503, 89.8%); a worsened class in which an
      initially moderate NPS burden increased (N = 39, 7.0%); and an improved
      class in which an initially high NPS burden decreased (N = 18, 3.2%).
      There were no associations between class membership and baseline
      individual characteristics. Members of the worsened class were 1.74 times
      more likely to be diagnosed with incident Alzheimer disease (AD) than
      members of the stable class (95% confidence interval: 1.07-2.84). The
      worsened class also showed significantly more rapid declines in cognitive
      and functional outcomes than the stable class. Class membership did not
      predict rate of brain atrophy.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Patients with MCI may experience different trajectories of NPS over time.
      Patients with worsening NPS may be at greater risk of developing AD and
      severe cognitive and functional impairment.

      Role of ABCA7 loss-of-function variant in Alzheimer's disease: a
      replication study in European-Americans
    journal: "Alzheimers Res Ther "
    volume: 7

      INTRODUCTION:

      A recent study found a significant increase of ABCA7 loss-of-function
      variants in Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases compared to controls. Some
      variants were located on noncoding regions, but it was demonstrated that
      they affect splicing. Here, we try to replicate the association between AD
      risk and ABCA7 loss-of-function variants at both the single-variant and
      gene level in a large and well-characterized European American dataset.

      METHODS:

      We genotyped the GWAS common variant and four rare variants previously
      reported for ABCA7 in 3476 European-Americans.

      RESULTS:

      We were not able to replicate the association at the single-variant level,
      likely due to a lower effect size on the European American population
      which led to limited statistical power. However, we did replicate the
      association at the gene level; we found a significant enrichment of ABCA7
      loss-of-function variants in AD cases compared to controls (P = 0.0388;
      odds ratio =1.54). We also confirmed that the association of the
      loss-of-function variants is independent of the previously reported
      genome-wide association study signal.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Although the effect size for the association of ABCA7 loss-of-function
      variants with AD risk is lower in our study (odds ratio = 1.54) compared
      to the original report (odds ratio = 2.2), the replication of the findings
      of the original report provides a stronger foundation for future
      functional applications. The data indicate that different independent
      signals that modify risk for complex traits may exist on the same locus.
      Additionally, our results suggest that replication of rare-variant studies
      should be performed at the gene level rather than focusing on a single
      variant.

      A potential endophenotype for Alzheimer's disease: cerebrospinal fluid

    abstract: >-
      Genome-wide association studies have associated clusterin (CLU) variants
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of CLU on AD pathogenesis
      is not totally understood. We used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma
      CLU levels as endophenotypes for genetic studies to understand the role of
      CLU in AD. CSF, but not plasma, CLU levels were significantly associated
      with AD status and CSF tau/amyloid-beta ratio, and highly correlated with
      CSF apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels. Several loci showed almost genome-wide
      significant associations including LINC00917 (p = 3.98 × 10(-7)) and
      interleukin 6 (IL6, p = 9.94 × 10(-6), in the entire data set and in the
      APOE ε4- individuals p = 7.40 × 10(-8)). Gene ontology analyses suggest
      that CSF CLU levels may be associated with wound healing and immune
      response which supports previous functional studies that demonstrated an
      association between CLU and IL6. CLU may play a role in AD by influencing
      immune system changes that have been observed in AD or by disrupting
      healing after neurodegeneration.

      Structured sparse canonical correlation analysis for brain imaging
      genetics: an improved GraphNet method
    journal: Bioinformatics
    volume: 32
    issue: 10
    pages: 1544-1551
    abstract: >-
      MOTIVATION:

      Structured sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) models have been
      used to identify imaging genetic associations. These models either use
      group lasso or graph-guided fused lasso to conduct feature selection and
      feature grouping simultaneously. The group lasso based methods require
      prior knowledge to define the groups, which limits the capability when
      prior knowledge is incomplete or unavailable. The graph-guided methods
      overcome this drawback by using the sample correlation to define the
      constraint. However, they are sensitive to the sign of the sample
      correlation, which could introduce undesirable bias if the sign is wrongly
      estimated.

      RESULTS:

      We introduce a novel SCCA model with a new penalty, and develop an
      efficient optimization algorithm. Our method has a strong upper bound for
      the grouping effect for both positively and negatively correlated
      features. We show that our method performs better than or equally to three
      competing SCCA models on both synthetic and real data. In particular, our
      method identifies stronger canonical correlations and better canonical
      loading patterns, showing its promise for revealing interesting imaging
      genetic associations.

      Variants in CCL16 are associated with blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid
      CCL16 protein levels
    journal: "BMC Genomics "
    volume: 17
    issue: 3
    pages: 437
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      CCL16 is a chemokine predominantly expressed in the liver, but is also
      found in the blood and brain, and is known to play important roles in
      immune response and angiogenesis. Little is known about the gene's
      regulation.

      METHODS:

      Here, we test for potential causal SNPs that affect CCL16 protein levels
      in both blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid in a genome-wide association
      study across two datasets. We then use METAL to performed meta-analyses
      with a significance threshold of p &lt; 5x10(-8). We removed SNPs where
      the direction of the effect was different between the two datasets.

      RESULTS:

      We identify 10 SNPs associated with increased CCL16 protein levels in both
      biological fluids.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Our results will help understand CCL16's regulation, allowing researchers
      to better understand the gene's effects on human health.

      "Common polygenic variation enhances risk prediction for Alzheimer's
      disease
    journal: Brain
    volume: 138
    issue: 12
    pages: 3673-3684
    abstract: >-
      The identification of subjects at high risk for Alzheimer's disease is
      important for prognosis and early intervention. We investigated the
      polygenic architecture of Alzheimer's disease and the accuracy of
      Alzheimer's disease prediction models, including and excluding the
      polygenic component in the model. This study used genotype data from the
      powerful dataset comprising 17 008 cases and 37 154 controls obtained from
      the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP). Polygenic score
      analysis tested whether the alleles identified to associate with disease
      in one sample set were significantly enriched in the cases relative to the
      controls in an independent sample. The disease prediction accuracy was
      investigated in a subset of the IGAP data, a sample of 3049 cases and 1554
      controls (for whom APOE genotype data were available) by means of
      sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve (AUC) and positive and negative predictive values. We observed
      significant evidence for a polygenic component enriched in Alzheimer's
      disease (P = 4.9 × 10(-26)). This enrichment remained significant after
      APOE and other genome-wide associated regions were excluded (P = 3.4 ×
      10(-19)). The best prediction accuracy AUC = 78.2% (95% confidence
      interval 77-80%) was achieved by a logistic regression model with APOE,
      the polygenic score, sex and age as predictors. In conclusion, Alzheimer's
      disease has a significant polygenic component, which has predictive
      utility for Alzheimer's disease risk and could be a valuable research tool
      complementing experimental designs, including preventative clinical
      trials, stem cell selection and high/low risk clinical studies. In
      modelling a range of sample disease prevalences, we found that
      polygenicscores almost doubles case prediction from chance with increased
      prediction at polygenic extremes.

    abstract: >-
      The accumulation of the toxic Aβ peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      largely relies upon an efficient recycling of amyloid precursor protein
      (APP). Recent genetic association studies have described rare variants in
      SORL1 with putative pathogenic consequences in the recycling of APP. In
      this work, we examine the presence of rare coding variants in SORL1 in
      three different European American cohorts: early-onset, late-onset AD
      (LOAD) and familial LOAD.

      Genetic influences on schizophrenia and subcortical brain volumes:
      large-scale proof of concept
    journal: "Nat Neurosci "
    volume: 19
    issue: 3
    pages: 420-431
    abstract: >-
      Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric illness with high heritability.
      Brain structure and function differ, on average, between people with
      schizophrenia and healthy individuals. As common genetic associations are
      emerging for both schizophrenia and brain imaging phenotypes, we can now
      use genome-wide data to investigate genetic overlap. Here we integrated
      results from common variant studies of schizophrenia(33,636 cases, 43,008
      controls) and volumes of several (mainly subcortical) brain structures
      (11,840 subjects). We did not find evidence of genetic overlap between
      schizophrenia risk and subcortical volume measures either at the level of
      common variant genetic architecture or for single genetic markers. These
      results provide a proof of concept (albeit based on a limited set of
      structural brain measures) and define a roadmap for future studies
      investigating the genetic covariance between structural or functional
      brain phenotypes and risk for psychiatric disorders.

      Identifying significant gene-environment interactions using a combination
      of screening testing and hierarchical false discovery rate control
    journal: "Genet Epidemiol "
    volume: 40
    issue: 7
    pages: 544-557
    abstract: >-
      Although gene-environment (G× E) interactions play an important role in
      many biological systems, detecting these interactions within genome-wide
      data can be challenging due to the loss in statistical power incurred by
      multiple hypothesis correction. To address the challenge of poor power and
      the limitations of existing multistage methods, we recently developed a
      screening-testing approach for G× E interaction detection that combines
      elastic net penalized regression with joint estimation to support a single
      omnibus test for the presence of G× E interactions. In our original work
      on this technique, however, we did not assess type I error control or
      power and evaluated the method using just a single, small bladder cancer
      data set. In this paper, we extend the original method in two important
      directions and provide a more rigorous performance evaluation. First, we
      introduce a hierarchical false discovery rate approach to formally assess
      the significance of individual G× E interactions. Second, to support the
      analysis of truly genome-wide data sets, we incorporate a score
      statistic-based prescreening step to reduce the number of single
      nucleotide polymorphisms prior to fitting the first stage penalized
      regression model. To assess the statistical properties of our method, we
      compare the type I error rate and statistical power of our approach with
      competing techniques using both simple simulation designs as well as
      designs based on real disease architectures. Finally, we demonstrate the
      ability of our approach to identify biologically plausible SNP-education
      interactions relative to Alzheimer's disease status using genome-wide
      association study data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI).

      Association of Long Runs of Homozygosity With Alzheimer Disease Among
      African American Individuals
    journal: "JAMA Neurol "
    volume: 72
    issue: 11
    pages: 1313-1323
    abstract: >-
      IMPORTANCE:

      Mutations in known causal Alzheimer disease (AD) genes account for only 1%
      to 3% of patients and almost all are dominantly inherited. Recessive
      inheritance of complex phenotypes can be linked to long (>1-megabase [Mb])
      runs of homozygosity (ROHs) detectable by single-nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) arrays.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the association between ROHs and AD in an African American
      population known to have a risk for AD up to 3 times higher than white
      individuals.

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:

      Case-control study of a large African American data set previously
      genotyped on different genome-wide SNP arrays conducted from December 2013
      to January 2015. Global and locus-based ROH measurements were analyzed
      using raw or imputed genotype data. We studied the raw genotypes from 2
      case-control subsets grouped based on SNP array: Alzheimer's
      DiseaseGenetics Consortium data set (871 cases and 1620 control
      individuals) and Chicago Health and Aging Project-Indianapolis Ibadan
      Dementia Study data set (279 cases and 1367 control individuals). We then
      examined the entire data set using imputed genotypes from 1917 cases and
      3858 control individuals.

      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:

      The ROHs larger than 1 Mb, 2 Mb, or 3 Mb were investigated separately for
      global burden evaluation, consensus regions, and gene-based analyses.

      RESULTS:

      The African American cohort had a low degree of inbreeding (F ~ 0.006). In
      the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data set, we detected a
      significantly higher proportion of cases with ROHs greater than 2 Mb
      (P = .004) or greater than 3 Mb (P = .02), as well as a significant
      114-kilobase consensus region on chr4q31.3 (empirical P value 2 = .04;
      ROHs >2 Mb). In the Chicago Health and Aging Project-Indianapolis Ibadan
      Dementia Study data set, we identified a significant 202-kilobase
      consensus region on Chr15q24.1 (empirical P value 2 = .02; ROHs >1 Mb) and
      a cluster of 13 significant genes on Chr3p21.31 (empirical P value
      2 = .03; ROHs >3 Mb). A total of 43 of 49 nominally significant genes
      common for both data sets also mapped to Chr3p21.31. Analyses of imputed
      SNP data from the entire data set confirmed the association of AD with
      global ROH measurements (12.38 ROHs >1 Mb in cases vs 12.11 in controls;
      2.986 Mb average size of ROHs >2 Mb in cases vs 2.889 Mb in controls; and
      22% of cases with ROHs >3 Mb vs 19% of controls) and a gene-cluster on
      Chr3p21.31 (empirical P value 2 = .006-.04; ROHs >3 Mb). Also, we detected
      a significant association between AD and CLDN17 (empirical P value
      2 = .01; ROHs >1 Mb), encoding a protein from the Claudin family, members
      of which were previously suggested as AD biomarkers.

      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

      To our knowledge, we discovered the first evidence of increased burden of
      ROHs among patients with AD from an outbred African American population,
      which could reflect either the cumulative effect of multiple ROHs to AD or
      the contribution of specific loci harboring recessive mutations and risk
      haplotypes in a subset of patients. Sequencing is required to uncover AD
      variants in these individuals.

      DIAGNOSIS-GUIDED METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING MULTI-MODALITY NEUROIMAGING
      BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH GENETIC RISK FACTORS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
    journal: "Pac Symp Biocomput "
    volume: 21
    pages: 108-119
    abstract: >-
      Many recent imaging genetic studies focus on detecting the associations
      between genetic markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
      quantitative traits (QTs). Although there exist a large number of
      generalized multivariate regression analysis methods, few of them have
      used diagnosis information in subjects to enhance the analysis
      performance. In addition, few of models have investigated the
      identification of multi-modality phenotypic patterns associated with
      interesting genotype groups in traditional methods. To reveal
      disease-relevant imaging genetic associations, we propose a novel
      diagnosis-guided multi-modality (DGMM) framework to discover
      multi-modalityimaging QTs that are associated with both Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) and its top genetic risk factor (i.e., APOE SNP rs429358).
      The strength of our proposed method is that it explicitly models the
      priori diagnosis information among subjects in the objective function for
      selecting the disease-relevant and robust multi-modality QTs associated
      with the SNP. We evaluate our method on two modalities of imaging
      phenotypes, i.e., those extracted from structural magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) data and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
      (FDG-PET) data in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
      database. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method
      not only achieves better performances under the metrics of root mean
      squared error and correlation coefficient but also can identify common
      informative regions of interests (ROIs) across multiple modalities to
      guide the disease-induced biological interpretation, compared with other
      reference methods.

      Identifying Multimodal Intermediate Phenotypes Between Genetic Risk
      Factors and Disease Status in Alzheimer's Disease
    journal: Neuroinformatics

      Neuroimaging genetics has attracted growing attention and interest, which
      is thought to be a powerful strategy to examine the influence of genetic
      variants (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) on structures or
      functions of human brain. In recent studies, univariate or multivariate
      regression analysis methods are typically used to capture the effective
      associations between genetic variants and quantitative traits (QTs) such
      as brain imaging phenotypes. The identified imaging QTs, although
      associated with certain genetic markers, may not be all disease specific.
      A useful, but underexplored, scenario could be to discover only those QTs
      associated with both genetic markers and disease status for revealing the
      chain from genotype to phenotype to symptom. In addition, multimodal brain
      imaging phenotypes are extracted from different perspectives and imaging
      markers consistently showing up in multimodalities may provide more
      insights for mechanistic understanding of diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's
      disease (AD)). In this work, we propose a general framework to exploit
      multi-modal brain imaging phenotypes as intermediate traits that bridge
      genetic risk factors and multi-class disease status. We applied our
      proposed method to explore the relation between the well-known AD risk SNP
      APOE rs429358 and three baseline brain imaging modalities (i.e.,
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron
      emission tomography (FDG-PET) and F-18 florbetapir PET scans amyloid
      imaging (AV45)) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
      (ADNI) database. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
      method not only helps improve the performances of imaging genetic
      associations, but also discovers robust and consistent regions of
      interests (ROIs) across multi-modalities to guide the disease-induced
      interpretation.

      The Rare-Variant Generalized Disequilibrium Test for Association Analysis
      of Nuclear and Extended Pedigrees with Application to Alzheimer Disease
      WGS Data

    volume: 100

    abstract: >-
      Whole-genome and exome sequence data can be cost-effectively generated for
      the detection of rare-variant (RV) associations in families. Causal
      variants that aggregate in families usually have larger effect sizes than
      those found in sporadic cases, so family-based designs can be a more
      powerful approach than population-based designs. Moreover, some
      family-based designs are robust to confounding due to population admixture
      or substructure. We developed a RV extension of the generalized
      disequilibrium test (GDT) to analyze sequence dataobtained from nuclear
      and extended families. The GDT utilizes genotype differences of all
      discordant relative pairs to assess associations within a family, and the
      RV extension combines the single-variant GDT statistic over a genomic
      region of interest. The RV-GDT has increased power by efficiently
      incorporating information beyond first-degree relatives and allows for the
      inclusion of covariates. Using simulated genetic data, we demonstrated
      that the RV-GDT method has well-controlled type I error rates, even when
      applied to admixed populations and populations with substructure. It is
      more powerful than existing family-based RV association methods,
      particularly for the analysis of extendedpedigrees and pedigrees with
      missing data. We analyzed whole-genome sequence data from families
      affected by Alzheimer disease to illustrate the application of the RV-GDT.
      Given the capability of the RV-GDT to adequately control for population
      admixture or substructure and analyze pedigrees with missing genotype data
      and its superior power over other family-based methods, it is an effective
      tool for elucidating the involvement of RVs in the etiology of complex
      traits.

      Genetic Analysis of Association Between Calcium Signaling and Hippocampal
      Activation, Memory Performance in the Young and Old, and Risk for Sporadic
      Alzheimer Disease.

    volume: 72

      IMPORTANCE:

      Human episodic memory performance is linked to the function of specific
      brain regions, including the hippocampus; declines as a result of
      increasing age; and is markedly disturbed in Alzheimer disease (AD), an
      age-associated neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the
      hippocampus. Exploring the molecular underpinnings of human episodic
      memory is key to the understanding of hippocampus-dependent cognitive
      physiology and pathophysiology.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To determine whether biologically defined groups of genes are enriched in
      episodic memory performance across age, memoryencoding-related brain
      activity, and AD.

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:

      In this multicenter collaborative study, which began in August 2008 and is
      ongoing, gene set enrichment analysis was done by using primary and
      meta-analysis data from 57 968 participants. The Swiss cohorts consisted
      of 3043 healthy young adults assessed for episodic memory performance. In
      a subgroup (n = 1119) of one of these cohorts, functional magnetic
      resonance imaging was used to identify gene set-dependent differences in
      brain activity related to episodic memory. The German Study on Aging,
      Cognition, and Dementia in Primary Care Patients cohort consisted of 763
      elderly participants without dementia who were assessed for episodic
      memory performance. The International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project
      case-control sample consisted of 54 162 participants (17 008 patients with
      sporadic AD and 37 154 control participants). Analyses were conducted
      between January 2014 and June 2015. Gene set enrichment analysis in all
      samples was done using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data.

      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:

      Episodic memory performance in the Swiss cohort and German Study on Aging,
      Cognition, and Dementia in Primary Care Patients cohort was quantified by
      picture and verbal delayed free recall tasks. In the functional magnetic
      resonance imaging experiment, activation of the hippocampus during
      encoding of pictures served as the phenotype of interest. In the
      International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project sample, diagnosis of
      sporadic AD served as the phenotype of interest.

      RESULTS:

      In the discovery sample, we detected significant enrichment for genes
      constituting the calcium signaling pathway, especially those related to
      the elevation of cytosolic calcium (P = 2 × 10-4). This enrichment was
      replicated in 2 additional samples of healthy young individuals (P = .02
      and .04, respectively) and a sample of healthy elderly participants
      (P = .004). Hippocampal activation (P = 4 × 10-4) and the risk for
      sporadic AD (P = .01) were also significantly enriched for genes related
      to the elevation of cytosolic calcium.

      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

      By detecting consistent significant enrichment in independent cohorts of
      young and elderly participants, this study identified that calcium
      signaling plays a central role in hippocampus-dependent human memory
      processes in cognitive health and disease, contributing to the
      understanding and potential treatment of hippocampus-dependent cognitive
      pathology.

      Family-based association analyses of imputed genotypes reveal genome-wide
      significant association of Alzheimer's disease with OSBPL6, PTPRG, and
      PDCL3
    journal: "Mol Psychiatry "

    abstract: >-
      The genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex and
      heterogeneous. Over 200 highly penetrant pathogenic variants in the genes
      APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 cause a subset of early-onset familial AD. On the
      other hand, susceptibility to late-onset forms of AD (LOAD) is
      indisputably associated to the ɛ4 allele in the gene APOE, and more
      recently to variants in more than two-dozen additional genes identified in
      the large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses
      reports. Taken together however, although the heritability in AD is
      estimated to be as high as 80%, a large proportion of the underlying
      genetic factors still remain to be elucidated. In this study, we performed
      a systematic family-based genome-wide association and meta-analysis on
      close to 15 million imputed variants from three large collections of AD
      families (~3500 subjects from 1070 families). Using a multivariate
      phenotype combining affection status and onset age, meta-analysis of the
      association results revealed three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      that achieved genome-wide significance for association with AD risk:
      rs7609954 in the gene PTPRG (P-value=3.98 × 10-8), rs1347297 in the gene
      OSBPL6 (P-value=4.53 × 10-8), and rs1513625 near PDCL3 (P-value=4.28 ×
      10-8). In addition, rs72953347 in OSBPL6 (P-value=6.36 × 10-7) and two
      SNPs in the gene CDKAL1 showed marginally significant association with
      LOAD (rs10456232, P-value=4.76 × 10-7; rs62400067, P-value=3.54 × 10-7).
      In summary, family-based GWAS meta-analysis of imputed SNPs revealed novel
      genomic variants in (or near) PTPRG, OSBPL6, and PDCL3 that influence risk
      for AD with genome-wide significance.

      Discovery of gene-gene interactions across multiple independent data sets
      of late onset Alzheimer disease from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics
      Consortium
    journal: Neurobiol Aging
    volume: 38
    pages: 141-150
    abstract: >-
      Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) has a complex genetic etiology,
      involving locus heterogeneity, polygenic inheritance, and
      gene-geneinteractions; however, the investigation of interactions in
      recent genome-wide association studies has been limited. We used a
      biological knowledge-driven approach to evaluate gene-gene interactions
      for consistency across 13 data sets from the Alzheimer Disease
      GeneticsConsortium. Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-SNP pairs
      within 3 gene-gene combinations were identified: SIRT1 × ABCB1, PSAP ×
      PEBP4, and GRIN2B × ADRA1A. In addition, we extend a previously identified
      interaction from an endophenotype analysis between RYR3 × CACNA1C.
      Finally, post hoc gene expression analyses of the implicated SNPs further
      implicate SIRT1 and ABCB1, and implicate CDH23 which was most recently
      identified as an AD risk locus in an epigenetic analysis of AD. The
      observed interactions in this article highlight ways in which genotypic
      variation related to disease may depend on the genetic context in which it
      occurs. Further, our results highlight the utility of evaluating genetic
      interactions to explain additional variance in AD risk and identify novel
      molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.

      Global and local ancestry in African-Americans: Implications for
      Alzheimer's disease risk.
    journal: Alzheimers Dement
    volume: 13
    issue: 3
    pages: 233-243
    abstract: >-
      INTRODUCTION:

      African-American (AA) individuals have a higher risk for late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) than Americans of primarily European ancestry
      (EA). Recently, the largest genome-wide association study in AAs to date
      confirmed that six of the Alzheimer's disease(AD)-related genetic variants
      originally discovered in EA cohorts are also risk variants in AA; however,
      the risk attributable to many of the loci (e.g., APOE, ABCA7) differed
      substantially from previous studies in EA. There likely are risk variants
      of higher frequency in AAs that have not been discovered.

      METHODS:

      We performed a comprehensive analysis of genetically determined local and
      global ancestry in AAs with regard to LOAD status.

      RESULTS:

      Compared to controls, LOAD cases showed higher levels of African ancestry,
      both globally and at several LOAD relevant loci, which explained risk for
      AD beyond global differences.

      DISCUSSION:

      Exploratory post hoc analyses highlight regions with greatest differences
      in ancestry as potential candidate regions for future genetic analyses.

      MRI-based brain atrophy rates in ADNI phase 2: acceleration and enrichment
      considerations for clinical trials
    journal: Neurobiol Aging
    volume: 37
    pages: 26-37
    abstract: >-
      The goal of this work was to assess statistical power to detect treatment
      effects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials using magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI)-derived brain biomarkers. We used unbiased
      tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to analyze n = 5,738 scans, from
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 participants scanned with
      both accelerated and nonaccelerated T1-weighted MRI at 3T. The study
      cohort included 198 healthy controls, 111 participants with significant
      memory complaint, 182 with early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and 177
      late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 155 AD patients, scanned at
      screening and 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The statistical power to track
      brain change in TBM-based imaging biomarkers depends on the interscan
      interval, disease stage, and methods used to extract numerical summaries.
      To achieve reasonable sample size estimates for potential clinical trials,
      the minimal scan interval was 6 months for LMCI and AD and 12 months for
      EMCI. TBM-based imaging biomarkers were not sensitive to MRI scan
      acceleration, which gave results comparable with nonaccelerated sequences.
      ApoE status and baseline amyloid-beta positron emission tomography data
      improved statistical power. Among healthy, EMCI, and LMCI participants,
      sample size requirements were significantly lower in the amyloid+/ApoE4+
      group than for the amyloid-/ApoE4- group. ApoE4 strongly predicted atrophy
      rates across brain regions most affected by AD, but the remaining 9 of the
      top 10 AD risk genes offered no added predictive value in this cohort.

      Risk factors and global cognitive status related to brain
      arteriolosclerosis in elderly individuals

    pages: 201-216
    abstract: >-
      Risk factors and cognitive sequelae of brain arteriolosclerosis pathology
      are not fully understood. To address this, we used multimodal data from
      the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative data sets. Previous studies showed evidence of
      distinct neurodegenerative disease outcomes and clinical-pathological
      correlations in the "oldest-old" compared to younger cohorts. Therefore,
      using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data set, we analyzed
      clinical and neuropathological data from two groups according to ages at
      death: &lt; 80 years (n = 1008) and ≥80 years (n = 1382). In both age
      groups, severe brain arteriolosclerosis was associated with worse
      performances on global cognition tests. Hypertension (but not diabetes)
      was a brain arteriolosclerosis risk factor in the younger group. In
      the ≥ 80 years age at death group, an ABCC9 gene variant (rs704180),
      previously associated with aging-relatedhippocampal sclerosis, was also
      associated with brain arteriolosclerosis. A post-hoc arterial spin
      labeling neuroimaging experiment indicated that ABCC9 genotype is
      associated with cerebral blood flow impairment; in a convenience sample
      from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 15, homozygous
      individuals), non-risk genotype carriers showed higher global cerebral
      blood flow compared to risk genotype carriers. We conclude that brain
      arteriolosclerosis is associated with altered cognitive status and a novel
      vascular genetic risk factor.

      Accelerating rates of cognitive decline and imaging markers associated
      with beta-amyloid pathology
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 86
    issue: 20
    pages: 1887-1896
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      To estimate points along the spectrum of β-amyloid pathology at which
      rates of change of several measures of neuronal injury and cognitive
      decline begin to accelerate.

      METHODS:

      In 460 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we estimated the
      points at which rates of florbetapir PET, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET,
      MRI, and cognitive and functional decline begin to accelerate with respect
      to baseline CSF Aβ42. Points of initial acceleration in rates of decline
      were estimated using mixed-effects regression.

      RESULTS:

      Rates of neuronal injury and cognitive and even functional decline
      accelerate substantially before the conventional threshold for amyloid
      positivity, with rates of florbetapir PET and FDG PET accelerating early.
      Temporal lobe atrophy rates also accelerate prior to the threshold, but
      not before the acceleration of cognitive and functional decline.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      A considerable proportion of patients with MCI would not meet inclusion
      criteria for a trial using the current threshold for amyloid positivity,
      even though on average, they are experiencing cognitive/functional decline
      associated with prethreshold levels of CSF Aβ42. Future trials in early
      Alzheimer disease might consider revising the criteria regarding β-amyloid
      thresholds to include the range of amyloid associated with the first signs

      Early role of vascular dysregulation on late-onset Alzheimer's disease
      based on multifactorial data-driven analysis

    abstract: >-
      Multifactorial mechanisms underlying late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD)
      are poorly characterized from an integrative perspective. Here
      spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-β deposition, metabolism,
      vascular, functional activity at rest, structural properties, cognitive
      integrity and peripheral proteins levels are characterized in relation to
      LOAD progression. We analyse over 7,700 brain images and tens of plasma
      and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Through a multifactorial
      data-drivenanalysis, we obtain dynamic LOAD-abnormality indices for all
      biomarkers, and a tentative temporal ordering of disease progression.
      Imaging results suggest that intra-brain vascular dysregulation is an
      early pathological event during disease development. Cognitive decline is
      noticeable from initial LOAD stages, suggesting early memory deficit
      associated with the primary disease factors. High abnormality levels are
      also observed for specific proteins associated with the vascular system's
      integrity. Although still subjected to the sensitivity of the algorithms
      and biomarkers employed, our results might contribute to the development
      of preventive therapeutic interventions.

      Rare Functional Variant in TM2D3 is Associated with Late-Onset Alzheimer's
      Disease.
    journal: PLoS Genet
    volume: 10
    issue: 10
    pages: e1006327
    abstract: >-
      We performed an exome-wide association analysis in 1393 late-onset
      Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) cases and 8141 controls from the CHARGE
      consortium. We found that a rare variant (P155L) in TM2D3 was enriched in
      Icelanders (~0.5% versus &lt;0.05% in other European populations). In 433
      LOAD cases and 3903 controls from the Icelandic AGES sub-study, P155L was
      associated with increased risk and earlier onset of LOAD [odds ratio (95%
      CI) = 7.5 (3.5-15.9), p = 6.6x10-9]. Mutation in the Drosophila TM2D3
      homolog, almondex, causes a phenotype similar to loss of Notch/Presenilin
      signaling. Human TM2D3 is capable of rescuing these phenotypes, but this
      activity is abolished by P155L, establishing it as a functionally damaging
      allele. Our results establish a rare TM2D3 variant in association with
      LOAD susceptibility, and together with prior work suggests possible links
      to the β-amyloid cascade.

    title: Transethnic genome-wide scan identifies novel Alzheimer's disease loci
    journal: Alzheimers Dement.
    abstract: >-
      INTRODUCTION:

      Genetic loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been identified in whites
      of European ancestry, but the genetic architecture of AD among other
      populations is less understood.

      METHODS:

      We conducted a transethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) for
      late-onset AD in Stage 1 sample including whites of European Ancestry,
      African-Americans, Japanese, and Israeli-Arabs assembled by the
      Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. Suggestive results from Stage 1
      from novel loci were followed up using summarized results in the
      International Genomics Alzheimer's Project GWAS dataset.

      RESULTS:

      Genome-wide significant (GWS) associations in single-nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP)-based tests (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) were identified for SNPs
      in PFDN1/HBEGF, USP6NL/ECHDC3, and BZRAP1-AS1 and for the interaction of
      the (apolipoprotein E) APOE ε4 allele with NFIC SNP. We also obtained GWS
      evidence (P &lt; 2.7 × 10-6) for gene-based association in the total
      sample with a novel locus, TPBG (P = 1.8 x 10-6).

      DISCUSSION:

      Our findings highlight the value of transethnic studies for identifying
      novel AD susceptibility loci.

      Alzheimer's Disease Risk Polymorphisms Regulate Gene Expression in the
      ZCWPW1 and the CELF1 Loci
    journal: "PLoS One "
    volume: 11
    issue: 2
    pages: e0148717
    abstract: >-
      Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a genetically complex and
      clinically heterogeneous disease. Recent large-scale genome wide
      association studies (GWAS) have identified more than twenty loci that
      modify risk for AD. Despite the identification of these loci, little
      progress has been made in identifying the functional variants that explain
      the association with AD risk. Thus, we sought to determine whether the
      novel LOAD GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alter expression of
      LOAD GWAS genes and whether expression of these genes is altered in AD
      brains. The majority of LOAD GWAS SNPs occur in gene dense regions under
      large linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks, making it unclear which gene(s)
      are modified by the SNP. Thus, we tested for brain expression quantitative
      trait loci (eQTLs) between LOAD GWAS SNPs and SNPs in high LD with the
      LOAD GWAS SNPs in all of the genes within the GWAS loci. We found a
      significant eQTL between rs1476679 and PILRB and GATS, which occurs within
      the ZCWPW1 locus. PILRB and GATS expression levels, within the ZCWPW1
      locus, were also associated with AD status. Rs7120548 was associated with
      MTCH2 expression, which occurs within the CELF1 locus. Additionally,
      expression of several genes within the CELF1 locus, including MTCH2, were
      highly correlated with one another and were associated with AD status. We
      further demonstrate that PILRB, as well as other genes within the GWAS
      loci, are most highly expressed in microglia. These findings together with
      the function of PILRB as a DAP12 receptor supports the critical role of
      microglia and neuroinflammation in AD risk.

      "Genome-wide linkage analyses of non-Hispanic white families identify
      novel loci for familial late-onset Alzheimer's disease
    journal: "Alzheimers Dement "
    volume: 12
    issue: 1
    pages: 43141
    abstract: >-
      INTRODUCTION:

      Few high penetrance variants that explain risk in late-onset Alzheimer's
      disease (LOAD) families have been found.

      METHODS:

      We performed genome-wide linkage and identity-by-descent (IBD) analyses on
      41 non-Hispanic white families exhibiting likely dominant inheritance of
      LOAD, and having no mutations at known familial Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      loci, and a low burden of APOE ε4 alleles.

      RESULTS:

      Two-point parametric linkage analysis identified 14 significantly linked
      regions, including three novel linkage regions for LOAD (5q32,
      11q12.2-11q14.1, and 14q13.3), one of which replicates a genome-wide
      association LOAD locus, the MS4A6A-MS4A4E gene cluster at 11q12.2. Five of
      the 14 regions (3q25.31, 4q34.1, 8q22.3, 11q12.2-14.1, and 19q13.41) are
      supported by strong multipoint results (logarithm of odds [LOD*] ≥1.5).
      Nonparametric multipoint analyses produced an additional significant locus
      at 14q32.2 (LOD* = 4.18). The 1-LOD confidence interval for this region
      contains one gene, C14orf177, and the microRNA Mir_320, whereas IBD
      analyses implicates an additional gene BCL11B, a regulator of
      brain-derived neurotrophic signaling, a pathway associated with
      pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases.

      DISCUSSION:

      Examination of these regions after whole-genome sequencing may identify
      highly penetrant variants for familial LOAD.

      "Amyloid negativity in patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer
      disease and MCI.
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 86
    issue: 15
    pages: 1377-1385
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      To examine the clinical and biomarker characteristics of patients with
      amyloid-negative Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment
      (MCI) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a
      prospective cohort study.

      METHODS:

      We first investigated the reliability of florbetapir- PET in patients with
      AD and patients with MCI using CSF-Aβ1-42 as a comparison amyloid
      measurement. We then compared florbetapir- vs florbetapir+ patients with
      respect to several AD-specific biomarkers, baseline and longitudinal
      cognitive measurements, and demographic and clinician report data.

      RESULTS:

      Florbetapir and CSF-Aβ1-42 +/- status agreed for 98% of ADs (89% of MCIs),
      indicating that most florbetapir- scans were a reliable representation of
      amyloid status. Florbetapir- AD (n = 27/177; 15%) and MCI (n = 74/217,
      34%) were more likely to be APOE4-negative (MCI 83%, AD 96%) than their
      florbetapir+ counterparts (MCI 30%, AD 24%). Florbetapir- patients also
      had less AD-specific hypometabolism, lower CSF p-tau and t-tau, and better
      longitudinal cognitive performance, and were more likely to be taking
      medication for depression. In MCI only, florbetapir- participants had less
      hippocampal atrophy and hypometabolism and lower functional activity
      questionnaire scores compared to florbetapir+ participants.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Overall, image analysis problems do not appear to be a primary explanation
      of amyloid negativity. Florbetapir- ADNI patients have a variety of
      clinical and biomarker features that differ from their florbetapir+
      counterparts, suggesting that one or more non-AD etiologies (which may
      include vascular disease and depression) account for their AD-like
      phenotype.

      White matter hyperintensities are a core feature of Alzheimer's disease:
      Evidence from the dominantly inherited Alzheimer network
    journal: "Ann Neurol "
    volume: 79
    issue: 6
    pages: 929-939
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are areas of increased signal on
      T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that most commonly
      reflect small vessel cerebrovascular disease. Increased WMH volume is
      associated with risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These
      observations are typically interpreted as evidence that vascular
      abnormalities play an additive, independent role contributing to symptom
      presentation, but not core features of AD. We examined the severity and
      distribution of WMH in presymptomatic PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutation
      carriers to determine the extent to which WMH manifest in individuals
      genetically determined to develop AD.

      METHODS:

      The study comprised participants (n = 299; age = 39.03 ± 10.13) from the
      Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, including 184 (61.5%) with a
      mutation that results in AD and 115 (38.5%) first-degree relatives who
      were noncarrier controls. We calculated the estimated years from expected
      symptom onset (EYO) by subtracting the affected parent's symptom onset age
      from the participant's age. Baseline MRI data were analyzed for total and
      regional WMH. Mixed-effects piece-wise linear regression was used to
      examine WMH differences between carriers and noncarriers with respect to
      EYO.

      RESULTS:

      Mutation carriers had greater total WMH volumes, which appeared to
      increase approximately 6 years before expected symptom onset. Effects were
      most prominent for the parietal and occipital lobe, which showed divergent
      effects as early as 22 years before estimated onset.

      INTERPRETATION:

      Autosomal-dominant AD is associated with increased WMH well before
      expected symptom onset. The findings suggest the possibility that WMHs are
      a core feature of AD, a potential therapeutic target, and a factor that
      should be integrated into pathogenic models of the disease. Ann Neurol
      2016;79:929-939.

      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with brain atrophy and
      hypometabolism in the ADNI cohort
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 87
    issue: 6
    pages: 595-600
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      We investigated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a risk factor for brain
      atrophy and glucose hypometabolism in older adults with or at risk of
      cognitive impairment.

      METHODS:

      Participants with the T2DM were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1/GO/2 cohorts). Analysis of covariance
      models were used to compare participants with and without T2DM,
      controlling for potential confounding factors.

      RESULTS:

      Whole brain volume and whole brain [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake
      were significantly different as a function of T2DM status, independent of
      baseline clinical diagnosis. On post hoc analysis, a lower whole brain
      volume was seen in participants with both mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      and T2DM (n = 76) compared with participants who had MCI but not T2DM (n =
      747; p = 0.009). Similarly, mean FDG uptake in gray matter and white
      matter was lower in participants with both MCI and T2DM (n = 72) than in
      participants with MCI without T2DM (n = 719; p = 0.04). Subsequent
      regional analysis revealed that the decreased FDG uptake in participants
      with both MCI and T2DM was mainly manifested in 3 brain regions: frontal
      lobe, sensory motor cortex, and striatum.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      T2DM may accelerate cognition deterioration in patients with MCI by
      affecting glucose metabolism and brain volume.

      Erratum to: Traumatic brain injury and age at onset of cognitive
      impairment in older adults
    journal: "J Neurol "
    volume: 263
    issue: 7
    pages: 1286
    abstract: "There is a deficiency of knowledge regarding how traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with age at onset (AAO) of cognitive impairment in older adults. Participants with a TBI history were identified from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI 1/GO/2) medical history database. Using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, the AAO was compared between those with and without TBI, and potential confounding factors were controlled. The AAO was also compared between those with mild TBI (mTBI) and moderate or severe TBI (sTBI). Lastly, the effects of mTBI were analyzed on the AAO of participants with clinical diagnoses of either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The AAO for a TBI group was 68.2 ± 1.1 years [95 % confidence interval (CI) 66.2–70.3, n = 62], which was significantly earlier than the AAO for the non-TBI group of 70.9 ± 0.2 years (95 % CI 70.5–71.4, n = 1197) ( p = 0.013). Participants with mTBI history showed an AAO of 68.5 ± 1.1 years ( n = 56), which was significantly earlier than the AAO for the non-TBI group ( p = 0.032). Participants with both MCI and mTBI showed an AAO of 66.5 ± 1.3 years (95 % CI 63.9–69.1, n = 45), compared to 70.6 ± 0.3 years for the non-TBI MCI group (95 % CI 70.1–71.1, n = 935) ( p = 0.016). As a conclusion, a history of TBI may accelerate the AAO of cognitive impairment by two or more years. These results were consistent with reports of TBI as a significant risk factor for cognitive decline in older adults, and TBI is associated with an earlier AAO found in patients with MCI or AD.\r\n"

      The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism is

      previously been shown to moderate amyloid-β-related memory decline and
      hippocampal atrophy in preclinical sporadic Alzheimer's disease. However,
      the effect of BDNF in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease is unknown.
      We aimed to determine the effect of BDNF Val66Met on cognitive function,
      hippocampal function, tau and amyloid-β in preclinical autosomal dominant
      Alzheimer's disease. We explored effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 on
      these relationships. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network conducted
      clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, biomarker and neuroimaging measures
      at baseline in 131 mutation non-carriers and 143 preclinical autosomal
      dominant Alzheimer'sdisease mutation carriers on average 12 years before
      clinical symptom onset. BDNF genotype data were obtained for mutation
      carriers (95 Val66 homozygotes, 48 Met66 carriers). Among preclinical
      mutation carriers, Met66 carriers had worse memory performance, lower
      hippocampal glucose metabolism and increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid
      tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) than Val66 homozygotes. Cortical
      amyloid-β and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β42 levels were significantly
      different from non-carriers but did not differ between preclinical
      mutation carrier Val66 homozygotes and Met66 carriers. There was an effect
      of APOE on amyloid-β levels, but not cognitive function, glucose
      metabolism or tau. As in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, the deleterious
      effects of amyloid-β on memory, hippocampalfunction, and tau in
      preclinical autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease mutation carriers are
      greater in Met66 carriers. To date, this is the only genetic factor found
      to moderate downstream effects of amyloid-β in autosomal dominant
      Alzheimer's disease.

      A semi-mechanism approach based on MRI and proteomics for prediction of
      conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease
    journal: "Sci Rep "
    volume: 6
    pages: 26712
    abstract: >-
      Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor phase of Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). As current treatments may be effective only at the early
      stages of AD, it is important to track MCI patients who will convert to
      AD. The aim of this study is to develop a high performance semi-mechanism
      based approach to predict the conversion from MCI to AD and improve our
      understanding of MCI-to-AD conversion mechanism. First, analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) test and lasso regression are employed to identify the
      markers related to the conversion. Then the Bayesian network based on
      selected markers is established to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. The
      structure of Bayesian network suggests that the conversion may start with
      fibrin clot formation, verbal memory impairment, eating pattern changing
      and hyperinsulinemia. The Bayesian network achieves a high 10-fold
      cross-validated prediction performance with 96% accuracy, 95% sensitivity,
      65% specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of
      0.82 on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
      database. The semi-mechanism based approach provides not only high
      prediction performance but also clues of mechanism for MCI-to-AD
      conversion.

      The effect of increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease on
      hippocampal and amygdala volume
    journal: "Neurobiol Aging "
    volume: 40
    pages: 68-77
    abstract: >-
      Reduction in hippocampal and amygdala volume measured via structural
      magnetic resonance imaging is an early marker of Alzheimer'sdisease (AD).
      Whether genetic risk factors for AD exert an effect on these subcortical
      structures independent of clinical status has not been fully investigated.
      We examine whether increased genetic risk for AD influences hippocampal
      and amygdala volumes in case-control and population cohorts at different
      ages, in 1674 older (aged >53 years; 17% AD, 39% mild cognitive impairment
      [MCI]) and 467 young (16-30 years) adults. An AD polygenic risk score
      combining common risk variants excluding apolipoprotein E (APOE), and a
      single nucleotide polymorphism in TREM2, were both associated with reduced
      hippocampal volume in healthy older adults and those with MCI. APOE ε4 was
      associated with hippocampal and amygdala volume in those with AD and MCI
      but was not associated in healthy older adults. No associations were found
      in young adults. Genetic risk for AD affects the hippocampus before the
      clinical symptoms of AD, reflecting a neurodegenerative effect before
      clinical manifestations in older adults.

      Periventricular hyperintensities are associated with elevated cerebral
      amyloid
    journal: "Neurology "
    volume: 86
    issue: 6
    pages: 535-543
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      To investigate the association between periventricular white mater
      hyperintensities (PVWMH) and biomarkers of elevatedcerebral β-amyloid (Aβ)
      in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a large prospective
      multicenter observational study.

      METHODS:

      The burden of frontal, parietal, and occipital PVWMH on 3T
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI was evaluated in 698 cognitively
      normal participants and participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      using a novel semiquantitative visual rating scale. Results were
      correlated with CSF-Aβ, florbetapir-PET, and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET.

      RESULTS:

      Increased burden of parietal, occipital, and frontal PVWMH was associated
      with elevated cerebral amyloid evidenced by high florbetapir-PET signal (p
      &lt; 0.01) and low CSF-Aβ (p &lt; 0.01). In logistic regression models,
      including PVWMH, age, sex, APOE status, vascular risk factors, pulse
      pressure, vascular secondary prevention medications, education, ethnicity,
      and race, parietal, occipital, and frontal PVWMH burden was independently
      associated with high florbetapir-PET uptake (p &lt; 0.05). In a similar
      logistic regression model, parietal and occipital (p &lt; 0.05) but not
      frontal (p = 0.05) PVWMH were independently associated with CSF-Aβ. Weaker
      associations were found between parieto-occipital PVWMH and elevated
      CSF-tau (p &lt; 0.05) and occipital PVWMH and elevated CSF-phospho-tau (p
      &lt; 0.05). PVWMH were associated with cerebral hypometabolism on FDG-PET
      independent of CSF-Aβ levels (p &lt; 0.05). Absolute and consistency of
      agreement intraclass correlation coefficients were, respectively, 0.83 and
      0.83 for frontal, 0.78 and 0.8 for parietal, and 0.45 and 0.75 for
      occipital PVWMH measurements.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Increased PVWMH were associated with elevated cerebral amyloid independent
      of potential confounders such as age, APOE genotype, and vascular risk
      factors. The mechanisms underlying the association between PVWMH and
      cerebral amyloid remain to be clarified.

      The executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum in Alzheimer's disease
      is highly heritable
    journal: Neurobiol Aging
    volume: 41
    pages: 115-121
    abstract: >-
      Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) can present heterogeneously, with
      several subtypes recognized, including dysexecutive AD. One way to
      identify people with dysexecutive AD is to consider the difference between
      memory and executive functioning, which we refer to as the executive
      prominent/memory prominent spectrum. We aimed to determine if this
      spectrum was heritable. We used neuropsychological and genetic data from
      people with mild LOAD (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 or 1.0) from the
      National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and the Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative. We cocalibrated the neuropsychological data to
      obtain executive functioning and memoryscores and used their difference as
      a continuous phenotype to calculate its heritability overall and by
      chromosome. Narrow-sense heritability of the difference between memory and
      executive functioning scores was 0.68 (standard error 0.12). Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 11, 12, and 18 explained
      the largest fraction of phenotypic variance, with signals from each
      chromosome accounting for 5%-7%. The chromosomal pattern of heritability
      differed substantially from that of LOAD itself.

      "Genetic Comparison of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Persons With Alzheimer
      Disease Neuropathology
    journal: Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord.
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      The objective was to determine whether symptomatic and asymptomatic
      persons with Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologyhave different allele
      counts for single-nucleotide polymorphisms that have been associated with
      clinical late-onset AD.

      METHODS:

      Data came from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data
      Set and Neuropathology Data Set, and the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics
      Consortium (ADGC). Participants had low to high AD neuropathologic change.
      The 22 known/suspected genes associated with late-onset AD were
      considered. "Symptomatic" was defined as Clinical Dementia Rating global
      score >0.

      RESULTS:

      Sixty-eight asymptomatic and 521 symptomatic participants met inclusion
      criteria. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ABCA7 [odds
      ratio (OR)=1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-2.85] and MAPT
      (OR=2.18; CI, 1.26-3.77) were associated with symptomatic status. In
      stratified analyses, loci containing CD2AP (OR=0.35; 95% CI, 0.16-0.74),
      ZCWPW1 (OR=2.98; 95% CI, 1.34-6.86), and MAPT (OR=3.73, 95% CI,
      1.30-11.76) were associated with symptomatic status in APOE e4 carriers.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      These findings potentially explain some of the variation in whether a
      person with AD neuropathology expresses symptoms. Understanding why some
      people remain cognitively normal despite having AD neuropathology could
      identify pathways to diseaseheterogeneity and guide treatment trials.

      Polygenic risk of Alzheimer disease is associated with early- and
      late-life processes
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 87
    issue: 5
    pages: 481-488
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      To examine associations between aggregate genetic risk and Alzheimer
      disease (AD) markers in stages preceding the clinical symptoms of dementia
      using data from 2 large observational cohort studies.

      METHODS:

      We computed polygenic risk scores (PGRS) using summary statistics from the
      International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project genome-wide association
      study of AD. Associations between PGRS and AD markers (cognitive decline,
      clinical progression, hippocampus volume, and β-amyloid) were assessed
      within older participants with dementia. Associations between PGRS and
      hippocampus volume were additionally examined within healthy younger
      participants (age 18-35 years).

      RESULTS:

      Within participants without dementia, elevated PGRS was associated with
      worse memory (p = 0.002) and smaller hippocampus (p = 0.002) at baseline,
      as well as greater longitudinal cognitive decline (memory: p = 0.0005,
      executive function: p = 0.01) and clinical progression (p &lt; 0.00001).
      High PGRS was associated with AD-like levels of β-amyloid burden as
      measured with florbetapir PET (p = 0.03) but did not reach statistical
      significance for CSF β-amyloid (p = 0.11). Within the younger group,
      higher PGRS was associated with smaller hippocampus volume (p = 0.05).
      This pattern was evident when examining a PGRS that included many loci
      below the genome-wide association study (GWAS)-level significance
      threshold (16,123 single nucleotide polymorphisms), but not when PGRS was
      restricted to GWAS-level significant loci (18 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms).

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Effects related to common genetic risk loci distributed throughout the
      genome are detectable among individuals without dementia. The influence of
      this genetic risk may begin in early life and make an individual more
      susceptible to cognitive impairment in late life. Future refinement of
      polygenic risk scores may help identify individuals at risk for AD
      dementia.

    volume: 11
    issue: 12
    pages: 1439-1451
    abstract: >-
      Observational research shows that higher body mass index (BMI) increases
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but it is unclear whether this association
      is causal. We applied genetic variants that predict BMI in Mendelian
      randomization analyses, an approach that is not biased by reverse
      causation or confounding, to evaluate whether higher BMI increases AD
      risk. We evaluated individual-level data from the AD Genetics Consortium
      (ADGC: 10,079 AD cases and 9613 controls), the Health and Retirement Study
      (HRS: 8403 participants with algorithm-predicted dementia status), and
      published associations from the Genetic and Environmental Risk for AD
      consortium (GERAD1: 3177 AD cases and 7277 controls). No evidence from
      individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms or polygenic scores indicated
      BMI increased AD risk. Mendelian randomization effect estimates per BMI
      point (95% confidence intervals) were as follows: ADGC, odds ratio (OR) =
      0.95 (0.90-1.01); HRS, OR = 1.00 (0.75-1.32); GERAD1, OR = 0.96
      (0.87-1.07). One subscore (cellular processes not otherwise specified)
      unexpectedly predicted lower AD risk.

      Amyloid in dementia associated with familial FTLD: not an innocent

    journal: Neurocase
    volume: 22
    issue: 1
    pages: 76-83
    abstract: >-
      Patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) can show
      superimposed amyloid pathology, though the impact of amyloid on the
      clinical presentation of FTLD is not well characterized. This
      cross-sectional case-control study compared clinical features,
      fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography metabolism and gray matter
      volume loss in 30 patients with familial FTLD in whom amyloid status was
      confirmed with autopsy or Pittsburgh compound B-PET. Compared to the
      amyloid-negative patients, the amyloid-positive patients performed
      significantly worse on several cognitive tests and showed hypometabolism
      and volume loss in more temporoparietal regions. Our results suggest that
      in FTLD amyloid positivity is associated with a more Alzheimer's
      disease-like pattern of neurodegeneration.

      Older Adults Taking AT1-Receptor Blockers Exhibit Reduced Cerebral Amyloid
      Retention
    journal: "J Alzheimers Dis "
    volume: 50
    issue: 3
    pages: 779-789
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Evidence suggests that angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers (ARBs) may be
      protective against dementia, and studies in transgenic animals indicate
      that this may be due to improved amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance.

      OBJECTIVE:

      We investigated whether taking ARBs was associated with an attenuation of
      age-related increases in cerebral Aβ retention, and reduced progression to
      dementia.

      METHODS:

      Eight hundred seventy-one stroke-free and dementia-free older adults from
      the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study underwent
      baseline lumbar puncture, and a subgroup (n = 124) underwent 12 and 24
      month follow-up lumbar puncture. Participants were followed at variable
      intervals for clinical progression to dementia. Linear mixed models and
      ANCOVA compared ARBs users with those taking other antihypertensives
      (O-antiHTN) or no antihypertensives (No-antiHTN) on cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) Aβ and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) levels. Cox regression and
      chi-square analyses compared groups on progression to dementia.

      RESULTS:

      ARBs users exhibited greater vascular risk and lower educational
      attainment than the No-antiHTN group. Longitudinal analyses indicated
      higher CSF Aβ and lower P-tau in ARBs users versus other groups.
      Cross-sectional analyses revealed age-related decreases in CSF Aβ in other
      groups but not ARBs users. ARBs users were less likely to progress to
      dementia and showed reduced rate of progression relative to the No-antiHTN
      group.

      DISCUSSION:

      Patients taking ARBs showed an attenuation of age-related decreases in CSF
      Aβ, a finding that is consistent with studies done in transgenic animals.
      These findings may partly explain why ARBs users show reduced progression
      to dementia despite their lower educational attainment and greater
      vascular risk burden.

      Genomics and CSF analyses implicate thyroid hormone in hippocampal

    journal: "Acta Neuropathol "
    volume: 132
    issue: 6
    pages: 841-858
    abstract: >-
      We report evidence of a novel pathogenetic mechanism in which thyroid
      hormone dysregulation contributes to dementia in elderly persons. Two
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 12p12 were the
      initial foci of our study: rs704180 and rs73069071. These SNPs were
      identified by separate research groups as risk alleles for non-Alzheimer's
      neurodegeneration. We found that the rs73069071 risk genotype was
      associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) pathology among people with the
      rs704180 risk genotype (National Alzheimer's Coordinating
      Center/Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium data; n = 2113, including
      241 autopsy-confirmed HS cases). Furthermore, both rs704180 and rs73069071
      risk genotypes were associated with widespread brain atrophy visualized by
      MRI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data; n = 1239). In human
      brain samples from the Braineac database, both rs704180 and rs73069071
      risk genotypes were associated with variation in expression of ABCC9, a
      gene which encodes a metabolic sensor protein in astrocytes. The
      rs73069071 risk genotype was also associated with altered expression of a
      nearby astrocyte-expressed gene, SLCO1C1. Analyses of human brain gene
      expression databases indicated that the chromosome 12p12 locus may
      regulate particular astrocyte-expressed genes induced by the active form
      of thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3). This is informative
      biologically, because the SLCO1C1 protein transports thyroid hormone into
      astrocytes from blood. Guided by the genomic data, we tested the
      hypothesis that altered thyroid hormone levels could be detected in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from persons with HS pathology. Total
      T3 levels in CSF were elevated in HS cases (p &lt; 0.04 in two separately
      analyzed groups), but not in Alzheimer's disease cases, relative to
      controls. No change was detected in the serum levels of thyroidhormone (T3
      or T4) in a subsample of HS cases prior to death. We conclude that brain
      thyroid hormone perturbation is a potential pathogenetic factor in HS that
      may also provide the basis for a novel CSF-based clinical biomarker.

      "Integration of bioinformatics and imaging informatics for identifying
      rare PSEN1 variants in Alzheimer's disease
    journal: BMC Med Genomics
    volume: 9
    issue: 1
    pages: 30
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Pathogenic mutations in PSEN1 are known to cause familial early-onset
      Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) but common variantsin PSEN1 have not been found
      to strongly influence late-onset AD (LOAD). The association of rare
      variants in PSEN1 with LOAD-related endophenotypes has received little
      attention. In this study, we performed a rare variant association analysis
      of PSEN1 with quantitative biomarkers of LOAD using whole genome
      sequencing (WGS) by integrating bioinformatics and imaging informatics.

      METHODS:

      A WGS data set (N = 815) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI) cohort was used in this analysis. 757 non-Hispanic
      Caucasian participants underwent WGS from a blood sample and high
      resolution T1-weighted structural MRI at baseline. An automated MRI
      analysis technique (FreeSurfer) was used to measure cortical thickness and
      volume of neuroanatomical structures. We assessed imaging and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers as LOAD-related quantitative
      endophenotypes. Single variant analyses were performed using PLINK and
      gene-based analyses of rare variants were performed using the optimal
      Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT-O).

      RESULTS:

      A total of 839 rare variants (MAF &lt; 1/√(2 N) = 0.0257) were found
      within a region of ±10 kb from PSEN1. Among them, six exonic (three
      non-synonymous) variants were observed. A single variant association
      analysis showed that the PSEN1 p. E318G variant increases the risk of LOAD
      only in participants carrying APOE ε4 allele where individuals carrying
      the minor allele of this PSEN1 risk variant have lower CSF Aβ1-42 and
      higher CSF tau. A gene-based analysis resulted in a significant
      association of rare but not common (MAF ≥ 0.0257) PSEN1variants with
      bilateral entorhinal cortical thickness.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      This is the first study to show that PSEN1 rare variants collectively show
      a significant association with the brain atrophy in regions preferentially
      affected by LOAD, providing further support for a role of PSEN1 in LOAD.
      The PSEN1 p. E318G variant increases the risk of LOAD only in APOE ε4
      carriers. Integrating bioinformatics with imaging informatics for
      identification of rare variants could help explain the missing
      heritability in LOAD.

      Hippocampal Sclerosis of Aging, a Common Alzheimer's Disease 'Mimic': Risk
      Genotypes are Associated with Brain Atrophy Outside the Temporal Lobe
    journal: "J Alzheimers Dis "
    volume: 52
    issue: 1
    pages: 373-383
    abstract: >-
      Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a common brain disease in
      older adults with a clinical course that is similar to Alzheimer'sdisease.
      Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have previously shown
      association with HS-Aging. The present study investigated structural brain
      changes associated with these SNPs using surface-based analysis.
      Participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort
      (ADNI; n = 1,239), with both MRI scans and genotype data, were used to
      assess the association between brain atrophy and previously identified
      HS-Aging risk SNPs in the following genes: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, and
      KCNMB2 (minor allele frequency for each is >30%). A fifth SNP (near the
      ABCC9 gene) was evaluated in post-hoc analysis. The GRN risk SNP
      (rs5848_T) was associated with a pattern of atrophy in the dorsomedial
      frontal lobes bilaterally, remarkable since GRN is a risk factor for
      frontotemporal dementia. The ABCC9 riskSNP (rs704180_A) was associated
      with multifocal atrophy whereas a SNP (rs7488080_A) nearby (∼50 kb
      upstream) ABCC9 was associatedwith atrophy in the right entorhinal cortex.
      Neither TMEM106B (rs1990622_T), KCNMB2 (rs9637454_A), nor any of the
      non-risk alleles were associated with brain atrophy. When all four
      previously identified HS-Aging risk SNPs were summed into a polygenic risk
      score, there was a pattern of associated multifocal brain atrophy in a
      predominately frontal pattern. We conclude that common SNPs previously
      linked to HS-Aging pathology were associated with a distinct pattern of
      anterior cortical atrophy. Genetic variation associated with HS-Aging
      pathology may represent a non-Alzheimer's disease contribution to atrophy
      outside of the hippocampus in older adults.

      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale variants in mild
      cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease: change over time and
      the effect of enrichment strategies
    journal: "Alzheimers Res Ther "
    volume: 8
    pages: 8
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Development of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has broadened
      into early interventions in individuals with modest cognitive impairment
      and a slow decline. The 11-item version of the Alzheimer's Disease
      Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale(ADAS-Cog) was originally developed to
      measure cognition in patients with mild to moderate AD. Attempts to
      improve its properties for early AD by removing items prone to ceiling
      and/or by adding cognitive measures known to be impaired early have
      yielded a number of ADAS-Cog variants. Using Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiative data, we compared the performance of the 3-, 5-,
      11- and 13-item ADAS-Cog variants in subjects with early AD. Given the
      interest in enrichment strategies, we also examined this aspect with a
      focus on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers.

      METHODS:

      Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD with available
      ADAS-Cog 13 and CSF data were analysed. The decline over time was defined
      by change from baseline. Direct cross-comparison of the ADAS-Cog variants
      was performed using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with higher values
      reflecting increased sensitivity to detect change over time.

      RESULTS:

      The decline over time on any of the ADAS-Cog variants was minimal in
      subjects with MCI. Approximately half of subjects with MCI fulfilled
      enrichment criteria for positive AD pathology. The impact of enrichment
      was detectable but subtle in MCI. The annual decline in mildAD was more
      pronounced but still modest. More than 90 % of subjects with mild AD had
      positive AD pathology. SNRs were low in MCI but greater in mild AD. The
      numerically largest SNRs were seen for the ADAS-Cog 5 in MCI and for both
      the 5- and 13-item ADAS-Cog variantsin mild AD, although associated
      confidence intervals were large.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      The possible value of ADAS-Cog expansion or reduction is less than
      compelling, particularly in MCI. In mild AD, adding items known to be
      impaired at early stages seems to provide more benefit than removing items
      on which subjects score close to ceiling.

      Beyond Trisomy 21: Phenotypic Variability in People with Down Syndrome
      Explained by Further Chromosome Mis-segregation and Mosaic Aneuploidy.
    journal: "Journal of Down Syndrome & Chromosome Abnormalities "
    volume: 2
    issue: 1
    pages: 4
    abstract: >-
      Phenotypic variability is a fundamental feature of the human population
      and is particularly evident among people with Down syndrome and/or
      Alzheimer’s disease. Herein, we review current theories of the potential
      origins of this phenotypic variability and propose a novel mechanism based
      on our finding that the Alzheimer’s disease-associated Aβ peptide, encoded
      on chromosome 21, disrupts the mitotic spindle, induces abnormal
      chromosome segregation, and produces mosaic populations of aneuploid cells
      in all tissues of people with Alzheimer’s disease and in mouse and cell
      models thereof. Thus, individuals exposed to increased levels of the Aβ
      peptide should accumulate mosaic populations of aneuploid cells, with
      different chromosomes affected in different tissues and in different
      individuals. Specifically, people with Down syndrome, who express elevated
      levels of Aβ peptide throughout their lifetimes, would be predicted to
      accumulate additional types of aneuploidy, beyond trisomy 21 and including
      changes in their trisomy 21 status, in mosaic cell populations. Such
      mosaic aneuploidy would introduce a novel form of genetic variability that
      could potentially underlie much of the observed phenotypic variability
      among people with Down syndrome, and possibly also among people with
      Alzheimer’s disease. This mosaic aneuploidy theory of phenotypic
      variability in Down syndrome is supported by several observations, makes
      several testable predictions, and identifies a potential approach to
      reducing the frequency of some of the most debilitating features of Down
      syndrome, including Alzheimer’s disease.

    journal: "Curr Alzheimer Res "
    volume: 13
    issue: 1
    pages: 43298
    abstract: >-
      Trisomy 21 and the consequent extra copy of the amyloid precursor protein
      (APP) gene and increased beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptide production underlie the
      universal development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and high risk
      of AD dementia in people with Down syndrome (DS). Trisomy 21 and other
      forms of aneuploidy also arise among neurons and peripheral cells in both
      sporadic and familial AD and in mouse and cell models thereof, reinforcing
      the conclusion that AD and DS are two sides of the same coin. The
      demonstration that 90% of the neurodegeneration in AD can be attributed to
      the selective loss of aneuploid neurons generated over the course of the
      disease indicates that aneuploidy is an essential feature of the
      pathogenic pathway leading to the depletion of neuronal cell populations.
      Trisomy 21 mosaicism also occurs in neurons and other cells from patients
      with Niemann-Pick C1 disease and from patients with familial or sporadic
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), as well as in their
      corresponding mouse and cell models. Biochemical studies have shown that
      Aβ induces mitotic spindle defects, chromosome mis-segregation, and
      aneuploidy in cultured cells by inhibiting specific microtubule motors
      required for mitosis. These data indicate that neuronal trisomy 21 and
      other types of aneuploidy characterize and likely contribute to multiple
      neurodegenerative diseases and are a valid target for therapeutic
      intervention. For example, reducing extracellular calcium or treating
      cells with lithium chloride (LiCl) blocks the induction of trisomy 21 by
      Aβ. The latter finding is relevant in light of recent reports of a lowered
      risk of dementia in bipolar patients treated with LiCl and in the
      stabilization of cognition in AD patients treated with LiCl.

    title: Assessment of the genetic variance of late-onset Alzheimer's disease
    journal: "Neurobiol Aging "
    volume: 41
    issue: 200
    pages: e213-220
    abstract: >-
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex genetic disorder with no effective
      treatments. More than 20 common markers have been identified, which are
      associated with AD. Recently, several rare variants have been identified
      in Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Triggering Receptor Expressed On
      Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) and Unc-5 Netrin Receptor C (UNC5C) that affect
      risk for AD. Despite the many successes, the genetic architecture of AD
      remains unsolved. We used Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis to (1)
      estimate phenotypic variance explained by genetics; (2) calculate genetic
      variance explained by known AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); and
      (3) identify the genomic locations of variation that explain the remaining
      unexplained genetic variance. In total, 53.24% of phenotypic variance is
      explained by genetics, but known AD SNPs only explain 30.62% of the
      genetic variance. Of the unexplained genetic variance, approximately 41%
      is explained by unknown SNPs in regions adjacent to known AD SNPs, and the
      remaining unexplained genetic variance outside these regions.

      Association Between Anticholinergic Medication Use and Cognition, Brain
      Metabolism, and Brain Atrophy in Cognitively Normal Older Adults
    journal: JAMA Neurol
    volume: 73
    issue: 6
    pages: 721-732
    abstract: >-
      IMPORTANCE:

      The use of anticholinergic (AC) medication is linked to cognitive
      impairment and an increased risk of dementia. To our knowledge, this is
      the first study to investigate the association between AC medication use
      and neuroimaging biomarkers of brain metabolismand atrophy as a proxy for
      understanding the underlying biology of the clinical effects of AC
      medications.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To assess the association between AC medication use and cognition, glucose
      metabolism, and brain atrophy in cognitivelynormal older adults from the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Indiana Memory
      and Aging Study (IMAS).

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:

      The ADNI and IMAS are longitudinal studies with cognitive, neuroimaging,
      and other data collected at regular intervals in clinical and academic
      research settings. For the participants in the ADNI, visits are repeated
      3, 6, and 12 months after the baseline visit and then annually. For the
      participants in the IMAS, visits are repeated every 18 months after the
      baseline visit (402 cognitively normal older adults in the ADNI and 49
      cognitively normal older adults in the IMAS were included in the present
      analysis). Participants were either taking (hereafter referred to as the
      AC+ participants [52 from the ADNI and 8 from the IMAS]) or not taking
      (hereafter referred to as the AC- participants [350 from the ADNI and 41
      from the IMAS]) at least 1 medication with medium or high AC activity.
      Data analysis for this study was performed in November 2015.

      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:

      Cognitive scores, mean fludeoxyglucose F 18 standardized uptake value
      ratio (participants from the ADNI only), and brain atrophy measures from
      structural magnetic resonance imaging were compared between AC+
      participants and AC- participants after adjusting for potential
      confounders. The total AC burden score was calculated and was related to
      target measures. The association of AC use and longitudinal clinical
      decline (mean [SD] follow-up period, 32.1 [24.7] months [range, 6-108
      months]) was examined using Cox regression.

      RESULTS:

      The 52 AC+ participants (mean [SD] age, 73.3 [6.6] years) from the ADNI
      showed lower mean scores on Weschler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory
      Immediate Recall (raw mean scores: 13.27 for AC+ participants and 14.16
      for AC- participants; P = .04) and the Trail Making Test Part B (raw mean
      scores: 97.85 seconds for AC+ participants and 82.61 seconds for AC-
      participants; P = .04) and a lower executive function composite score (raw
      mean scores: 0.58 for AC+ participants and 0.78 for AC- participants;
      P = .04) than the 350 AC- participants (mean [SD] age, 73.3 [5.8] years)
      from the ADNI. Reduced total cortical volume and temporal lobe cortical
      thickness and greater lateral ventricle and inferior lateral ventricle
      volumes were seen in the AC+ participants relative to the AC-
      participants.

      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

      The use of AC medication was associated with increased brain atrophy and
      dysfunction and clinical decline. Thus, use of AC medication among older
      adults should likely be discouraged if alternative therapies are
      available.

    title: Morphometricity as a measure of the neuroanatomical signature of a trait
    journal: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
    volume: 113
    issue: 39
    pages: E5749-5756
    abstract: >-
      Complex physiological and behavioral traits, including neurological and
      psychiatric disorders, often associate with distributed anatomical
      variation. This paper introduces a global metric, called morphometricity,
      as a measure of the anatomical signature of different traits.
      Morphometricity is defined as the proportion of phenotypic variation that
      can be explained by macroscopic brain morphology. We estimate
      morphometricity via a linear mixed-effects model that uses an anatomical
      similarity matrix computed based on measurements derived from structural
      brain MRI scans. We examined over 3,800 unique MRI scans from nine
      large-scale studies to estimate the morphometricity of a range of
      phenotypes, including clinical diagnoses such as Alzheimer's disease, and
      nonclinical traits such as measures of cognition. Our results demonstrate
      that morphometricity can provide novel insights about the neuroanatomical
      correlates of a diverse set of traits, revealing associations that might
      not be detectable through traditional statistical techniques.

      Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been effective approaches to
      dissect common genetic variability underlying complex diseases in a
      systematic and unbiased way. Recently, GWASs have led to the discovery of
      over 20 susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease(AD). Despite the
      evidence showing the contribution of these loci to AD pathogenesis, their
      genetic architecture has not been extensively investigated, leaving the
      possibility that low frequency and rare coding variants may also occur and
      contribute to the risk of disease. We have used exome and genome
      sequencing data to analyze the single independent and joint effect of rare
      and low-frequency protein coding variants in 9 AD GWAS loci with the
      strongest effect sizes after APOE (BIN1, CLU, CR1, PICALM, MS4A6A, ABCA7,
      EPHA1, CD33, and CD2AP) in a cohort of 332 sporadic AD cases and 676
      elderly controls of British and North-American ancestry. We identified
      coding variability in ABCA7 as contributing to AD risk. This locus harbors
      a low-frequency coding variant (p.G215S, rs72973581, minor allele
      frequency = 4.3%) conferring a modest but statistically significant
      protection against AD (p-value = 0.024, odds ratio = 0.57, 95% confidence
      interval = 0.41-0.80). Notably, our results are not driven by an
      enrichment of loss of function variants in ABCA7, recently reported as
      main pathogenic factor underlying AD risk at this locus. In summary, our
      study confirms the role of ABCA7 in AD and provides new insights that
      should address functional studies.

      Influence of Coding Variability in APP-Abeta Metabolism Genes in Sporadic
      Alzheimer's Disease
    journal: "PLoS One "
    volume: 11
    issue: 6
    pages: e0150079
    abstract: >-
      The cerebral deposition of Aβ42, a neurotoxic proteolytic derivate of
      amyloid precursor protein (APP), is a central event in Alzheimer'sdisease
      (AD)(Amyloid hypothesis). Given the key role of APP-Aβ metabolism in AD
      pathogenesis, we selected 29 genes involved in APP processing, Aβ
      degradation and clearance. We then used exome and genome sequencing to
      investigate the single independent (single-variant association test) and
      cumulative (gene-based association test) effect of coding variants in
      these genes as potential susceptibility factors for AD, in a cohort
      composed of 332 sporadic and mainly late-onset AD cases and 676 elderly
      controls from North America and the UK. Our study shows that common coding
      variability in these genes does not play a major role for the disease
      development. In the single-variant association analysis, the main hits,
      none of which statistically significant after multiple testing correction
      (1.9e-4&lt;p-value&lt;0.05), were found to be rare coding variants
      (0.009%&lt;MAF&lt;1.4%) with moderate to strong effect size
      (1.84&lt;OR&lt;Inf) that map to genes mainly involved in Aβ extracellular
      degradation (TTR, ACE), clearance (LRP1) and APP trafficking and recycling
      (SORL1). These results were partially replicated in the gene-based
      analysis (c-alpha and SKAT tests), that reports ECE1, LYZ and TTR as
      nominally associated to AD (1.7e-3 &lt;p-value &lt;0.05). In concert with
      previous studies, we suggest that 1) common coding variability in APP-Aβ
      genes is not a critical factor for AD development and 2) Aβ degradation
      and clearance, rather than Aβ production, may play a key role in the
      etiology of sporadic AD.

      Basal forebrain degeneration precedes and predicts the cortical spread of
      Alzheimer's pathology
    journal: "Nat Commun "
    volume: 7
    pages: 13249
    abstract: >-
      There is considerable debate whether Alzheimer's disease (AD) originates
      in basal forebrain or entorhinal cortex. Here we examined whether
      longitudinal decreases in basal forebrain and entorhinal cortex grey
      matter volume were interdependent and sequential. In a large cohort of
      age-matched older adults ranging from cognitively normal to AD, we
      demonstrate that basal forebrain volume predicts longitudinal entorhinal
      degeneration. Models of parallel degeneration or entorhinal origin
      received negligible support. We then integrated volumetric measures with
      an amyloid biomarker sensitive to pre-symptomatic AD pathology. Comparison
      between cognitively matched normal adult subgroups, delineated according
      to the amyloid biomarker, revealed abnormal degeneration in basal
      forebrain, but not entorhinal cortex. Abnormal degeneration in both basal
      forebrain and entorhinal cortex was only observed among prodromal (mildly
      amnestic) individuals. We provide evidence that basal forebrain pathology
      precedes and predicts both entorhinal pathology and memory impairment,
      challenging the widely held belief that AD has a cortical origin.

      Genetically-controlled Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 1 expression
      may contribute to Alzheimer's pathophysiology and susceptibility
    journal: "Mol Neurodegener "
    volume: 10
    pages: 18
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder in which extracellular
      deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers causes synaptic injury resulting in
      early memory loss, altered homeostasis, accumulation of
      hyperphosphorylated tau and cell death. Since proteins in the SNAP
      (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment Protein) REceptors
      (SNARE) complex are essential for neuronal Aβ release at pre-synaptic
      terminals, we hypothesized that genetically controlled SNARE expression
      could alter neuronal Aß release at the synapse and hence play an early
      role in Alzheimer's pathophysiology.

      RESULTS:

      Here we report 5 polymorphisms in Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein 1
      (VAMP1), a gene encoding a member of the SNARE complex, associated with
      bidirectionally altered cerebellar VAMP1 transcript levels (all
      p&lt;0.05). At the functional level, we demonstrated that control of VAMP1
      expression by heterogeneous knockdown in mice resulted in up to 74%
      reduction in neuronal Aβ exocytosis (p&lt;0.001). We performed a
      case-control association study of the 5 VAMP1 expression regulating
      polymorphisms in 4,667 Alzheimer's disease patients and 6,175 controls to
      determine their contribution to Alzheimer's disease risk. We found that
      polymorphisms associated with increased brain VAMP1 transcript levels
      conferred higher risk for Alzheimer's disease than those associated with
      lower VAMP1 transcript levels (p=0.03). Moreover, we also report a modest
      protective association for a common VAMP1 polymorphism with Alzheimer's
      disease risk (OR=0.88, p=0.03). This polymorphism was associated with
      decreased VAMP1 transcript levels (p=0.02) and was functionally active in
      a dual luciferase reporter gene assay (p&lt;0.01).

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Genetically regulated VAMP1 expression in the brain may modify both
      Alzheimer's disease risk and may contribute to Alzheimer's
      pathophysiology.

      Inflammatory Biomarkers and Cognitive Decline: The Ginkgo Evaluation of
      Memory Study
    journal: "J Am Geriatr Soc "
    volume: 64
    issue: 6
    pages: 1171-1177
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVES:

      To examine the association between inflammatory biomarkers and global
      cognitive function.

      DESIGN:

      Case-cohort.

      SETTING:

      Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study.

      PARTICIPANTS:

      Individuals aged 75 and older free of neurological or neurodegenerative
      conditions recruited from 2000 to 2002 (N = 1,315).

      MEASUREMENTS:

      Outcome was cognitive function assessed using the modified Mini-Mental
      State Examination (3MSE) every 6 months for up to 7 years. Exposures were
      10 biomarkers measured at baseline: interleukin-2, -6, and -10 (general
      systemic inflammation); pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and serum amyloid P (SAP)
      (vascular inflammation); plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, adiponectin,
      and resistin (metabolic function); receptor for advanced glycation
      endproduct (oxidative stress); and endothelin-1 (endothelial function).
      Associations between biomarkers and 3MSE scores (stratified according to
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline) were analyzed using Cox
      regression (outcome: 3MSE decline of ≥5 points) and mixed-model
      regression. Bonferroni correction was used to determine significance
      threshold (P &lt; .0025).

      RESULTS:

      In individuals with baseline MCI, PTX3 was associated with a 20% greater
      hazard of cognitive decline (95% confidence interval = 1.07-1.35),
      although this association was no longer statistically significant after
      adjustment for apolipoprotein (APO)E ε4 allele. Adiponectin was associated
      with faster rate of 3MSE decline in individuals without baseline MCI in
      mixed-model regression, but the association was similarly attenuated after
      adjustment for APOE-ε4.

      CONCLUSION:

      This study did not find strong evidence of the utility of the biomarkers
      evaluated for identifying individuals at risk of cognitive decline. Future
      studies investigating the association between PTX3, SAP, and adiponectin
      and 3MSE scores may be useful.

      Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) polymorphisms exert protective effects on memory
      after mild traumatic brain injury
    journal: "Neurosci Lett "
    volume: 630
    pages: 241-246
    abstract: >-
      Problems with attention and short-term learning and memory are commonly
      reported after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Due to the known
      relationships between α-synuclein (SNCA), dopaminergic transmission, and
      neurologic deficits, we hypothesized that SNCApolymorphisms might be
      associated with cognitive outcome after mTBI. A cohort of 91 mTBI patients
      one month after injury and 86 healthy controls completed a series of
      cognitive tests assessing baseline intellectual function, attentional
      function, and memory, and was genotyped at 13 common single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SNCA gene. Significant differences in two
      memory measures (p=0.001 and 0.002), but not baseline intellectual
      function or attentional function tasks, were found between the mTBI group
      and controls. A highly significant protective association between memory
      performance and SNCA promoter SNP rs1372525 was observed in the mTBI
      patients (p=0.006 and 0.029 for the long and short delay conditions of the
      California Verbal Learning Tests, respectively), where the presence of at
      least one copy of the A (minor) allele was protective after mTBI. These
      results may help elucidate the pathophysiology of cognitive alterations
      after mTBI, and thus warrant further investigation.

      Reference tissue normalization in longitudinal (18)F-florbetapir positron
      emission tomography of late mild cognitive impairment
    journal: "Alzheimers Res Ther "
    volume: 8
    pages: 2
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Semiquantitative methods such as the standardized uptake value ratio
      (SUVR) require normalization of the radiotracer activity to a reference
      tissue to monitor changes in the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques
      measured with positron emission tomography(PET). The objective of this
      study was to evaluate the effect of reference tissue normalization in a
      test-retest (18)F-florbetapir SUVR study using cerebellar gray matter,
      white matter (two different segmentation masks), brainstem, and corpus
      callosum as reference regions.

      METHODS:

      We calculated the correlation between (18)F-florbetapir PET and concurrent
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42 levels in a late mildcognitive impairment
      cohort with longitudinal PET and CSF data over the course of 2 years. In
      addition to conventional SUVR analysis using mean and median values of
      normalized brain radiotracer activity, we investigated a new image
      analysis technique-the weighted two-point correlation function (wS2)-to
      capture potentially more subtle changes in Aβ-PET data.

      RESULTS:

      Compared with the SUVRs normalized to cerebellar gray matter, all
      cerebral-to-white matter normalization schemes resulted in a higher
      inverse correlation between PET and CSF Aβ1-42, while the brainstem
      normalization gave the best results (high and most stable correlation).
      Compared with the SUVR mean and median values, the wS2 values were
      associated with the lowest coefficient of variation and highest inverse
      correlation to CSF Aβ1-42 levels across all time points and reference
      regions, including the cerebellar gray matter.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      The selection of reference tissue for normalization and the choice of
      image analysis method can affect changes in cortical (18)F-florbetapir
      uptake in longitudinal studies.

      Network-based analysis of genetic variants associated with hippocampal
      volume in Alzheimer's disease: a study of ADNI cohorts
    journal: BioData Min
    volume: 9
    pages: 3
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes
      dementia. While molecular basis of AD is not fully understood, genetic
      factors are expected to participate in the development and progression of
      the disease. Our goal was to uncover novel genetic underpinnings of
      Alzheimer's disease with a bioinformatics approach that accounts for
      tissue specificity.

      FINDINGS:

      We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for hippocampal volume
      in two Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. We used
      these GWAS in a subsequent tissue-specific network-wide association study
      (NetWAS), which applied nominally significant associations in the initial
      GWAS to identify disease relevant patterns in a functional network for the
      hippocampus. We compared prioritized gene lists from NetWAS and GWAS with
      literature curated AD-associated genes from the Online Mendelian
      Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. In the ADNI-1 GWAS, where we also
      observed an enrichment of low p-values, NetWAS prioritized disease-gene
      associations in accordance with OMIM annotations. This was not observed in
      the ADNI-2 dataset. We provide source code to replicate these analyses as
      well as complete results under permissive licenses.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      We performed the first analysis of hippocampal volume using NetWAS, which
      uses machine learning algorithms applied to tissue-specific functional
      interaction network to prioritize GWAS results. Our findings support the
      idea that tissue-specific networks may provide helpful context for
      understanding the etiology of common human diseases and reveal challenges
      that network-based approaches encounter in some datasets. Our source code
      and intermediate results files can facilitate the development of methods
      to address these challenges.

      The effect of the top 20 Alzheimer disease risk genes on gray-matter
      density and FDG PET brain metabolism
    journal: "Alzheimers Dement (Amst) "
    volume: 5
    issue: 53
    pages: 66
    abstract: >-
      INTRODUCTION:

      We analyzed the effects of the top 20 Alzheimer disease (AD) risk genes on
      gray-matter density (GMD) and metabolism.

      METHODS:

      We ran stepwise linear regression analysis using posterior cingulate
      hypometabolism and medial temporal GMD as outcomes and all risk variants
      as predictors while controlling for age, gender, and APOE ε4 genotype. We
      explored the results in 3D using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8.

      RESULTS:

      Significant predictors of brain GMD were SLC24A4/RIN3 in the pooled and
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI); ZCWPW1 in the MCI; and ABCA7, EPHA1, and
      INPP5D in the AD groups. Significant predictors of hypometabolism were
      EPHA1 in the pooled, and SLC24A4/RIN3, NME8, and CD2AP in the normal
      control group.

      DISCUSSION:

      Multiple variants showed associations with GMD and brain metabolism. For
      most genes, the effects were limited to specific stages of the cognitive
      continuum, indicating that the genetic influences on brain metabolism and
      GMD in AD are complex and stage dependent.

      Variants in ACPP are associated with cerebrospinal fluid Prostatic Acid
      Phosphatase levels
    journal: "BMC Genomics  "
    volume: 17
    issue: 3
    pages: 439
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) is an enzyme that is produced primarily
      in the prostate and functions as a cell growth regulator and potential
      tumor suppressor. Understanding the genetic regulation of this enzyme is
      important because PAP plays an important role in prostate cancer and is
      expressed in other tissues such as the brain.

      METHODS:

      We tested association between 5.8 M SNPs and PAP levels in cerebrospinal
      fluid across 543 individuals in two datasets using linear regression. We
      then performed meta-analyses using METAL =with a significance threshold of
      p &lt; 5 × 10(-8) and removed SNPs where the direction of the effect was
      different between the two datasets, identifying 289 candidate SNPs that
      affect PAP cerebrospinal fluid levels. We analyzed each of these SNPs
      individually and prioritized SNPs that had biologically meaningful
      functional annotations in wANNOVAR (e.g. non-synonymous, stop gain, 3'
      UTR, etc.) or had a RegulomeDB score less than 3.

      RESULTS:

      Thirteen SNPs met our criteria, suggesting they are candidate causal
      alleles that underlie ACPP regulation and expression.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Given PAP's expression in the brain and its role as a cell-growth
      regulator and tumor suppressor, our results have important implications in
      brain health such as cancer and other brain diseases including
      neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's
      disease) and mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia).

      Genome-wide association study of prolactin levels in blood plasma and
      cerebrospinal fluid
    journal: "BMC Genomics "
    volume: 17
    issue: 3
    pages: 436
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Prolactin is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary
      gland that plays an essential role in lactation, tissue growth, and
      suppressing apoptosis to increase cell survival. Prolactin serves as a key
      player in many life-critical processes, including immune system and
      reproduction. Prolactin is also found in multiple fluids throughout the
      body, including plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

      METHODS:

      In this study, we measured prolactin levels in both plasma and CSF, and
      performed a genome-wide association study. We then performed meta-analyses
      using METAL with a significance threshold of p &lt; 5 × 10(-8) and removed
      SNPs where the direction of the effect was different between the two
      datasets.

      RESULTS:

      We identified 12 SNPs associated with increased prolactin levels in both
      biological fluids.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Our efforts will help researchers understand how prolactin is regulated in
      both CSF and plasma, which could be beneficial in research for the immune
      system and reproduction.

      Better verbal memory in women than men in MCI despite similar levels of
      hippocampal atrophy
    journal: Neurology
    volume: 85
    issue: 15
    pages: 1368-1376
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      To examine sex differences in the relationship between clinical symptoms
      related to Alzheimer disease (AD) (verbal memorydeficits) and
      neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume/intracranial volume ratio [HpVR])
      across AD stages.

      METHODS:

      The sample included 379 healthy participants, 694 participants with
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 235 participants with AD
      and dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who
      completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Cross-sectional
      analyses were conducted using linear regression to examine the interaction
      between sex and HpVR on RAVLT across and within diagnostic groups
      adjusting for age, education, and APOE ε4 status.

      RESULTS:

      Across groups, there were significant sex × HpVR interactions for
      immediate and delayed recall (p &lt; 0.01). Women outperformed men among
      individuals with moderate to larger HpVR, but not among individuals with
      smaller HpVR. In diagnosis-stratified analyses, the HpVR × sex interaction
      was significant in the aMCI group, but not in the control or AD dementia
      groups, for immediate and delayed recall (p &lt; 0.01). Among controls,
      women outperformed men on both outcomes irrespective of HpVR (p &lt;
      0.001). In AD dementia, better RAVLT performance was independently
      associated with female sex (immediate, p = 0.04) and larger HpVR (delayed,
      p = 0.001).

      CONCLUSION:

      Women showed an advantage in verbal memory despite evidence of moderate
      hippocampal atrophy. This advantage may represent a sex-specific form of
      cognitive reserve delaying verbal memory decline until more advanced
      disease stages.

      " Effect of CLU genetic variants on cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging
      markers in healthy, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
      cohorts
    journal: Sci Rep
    volume: 6
    pages: 26027
    abstract: >-
      The Clusterin (CLU) gene, also known as apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), is
      currently the third most associated late-onset Alzheimer's disease(LOAD)
      risk gene. However, little was known about the possible effect of CLU
      genetic variants on AD pathology in brain. Here, we evaluated the
      interaction between 7 CLU SNPs (covering 95% of genetic variations) and
      the role of CLU in β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, AD-related structure
      atrophy, abnormal glucose metabolism on neuroimaging and CSF markers to
      clarify the possible approach by that CLU impacts AD. Finally, four loci
      (rs11136000, rs1532278, rs2279590, rs7982) showed significant associations
      with the Aβ deposition at the baseline level while genotypes of rs9331888
      (P = 0.042) increased Aβ deposition. Besides, rs9331888 was significantly
      associated with baseline volume of left hippocampus (P = 0.014). We then
      further validated the association with Aβ deposition in the AD, mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI), normal control (NC) sub-groups. The results in
      sub-groups confirmed the association between CLU genotypes and Aβ
      deposition further. Our findings revealed that CLU genotypes could
      probably modulate the cerebral the Aβ loads on imaging and volume of
      hippocampus. These findings raise the possibility that the biological
      effects of CLU may be relatively confined to neuroimaging trait and hence
      may offer clues to AD.

      Neurological manifestations of autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's
      disease: a comparison of the published literature with the Dominantly
      Inherited Alzheimer Network observational study (DIAN-OBS)
    journal: Lancet Neurol
    volume: 15
    issue: 13
    pages: 1314-1325
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Autosomal dominant familial Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) is a rare disorder
      with non-amnestic neurological symptoms in some clinical presentations. We
      aimed to compile and compare data from symptomatic participants in the
      Dominantly Inherited AlzheimerNetwork observational study (DIAN-OBS) with
      those reported in the literature to estimate the prevalences of
      non-amnestic neurologicalsymptoms in participants with ADAD.

      METHODS:

      We prospectively collected data from the DIAN-OBS database, which
      recruited participants from study centres in the USA, Europe, and
      Australia, between Feb 29, 2008, and July 1, 2014. We also did a
      systematic review of publications to extract individual-level clinical
      data for symptomatic participants with ADAD. We used data for age of onset
      (from first report of cognitive decline), disease course from onset to
      death, and the presence of 13 neurological findings that have been
      reported in association with ADAD. Using multivariable linear regression,
      we investigated the prevalences of various non-amnestic neurological
      symptoms and the contributions of age of onset and specific mutation type
      on symptoms.

      FINDINGS:

      The DIAN-OBS dataset included 107 individuals with detailed clinical data
      (forming the DIAN-OBS cohort). Our systematic review yielded 188
      publications reporting on 1228 symptomatic individuals, with detailed
      neurological examination descriptions available for 753 individuals
      (forming the published data cohort). The most prevalent non-amnestic
      cognitive manifestations in participants in the DIAN-OBScohort were those
      typical of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, including visual agnosia
      (55·1%, 95% CI 45·7-64·6), aphasia (57·9%, 48·6-67·3), and behavioural
      changes (61·7%, 51·5-70·0). Non-amnestic cognitive manifestations were
      less prevalent in the published data cohort (eg, visual agnosia [5·6%,
      3·9-7·2], aphasia [23·0%, 20·0-26·0], and behavioural changes [31·7%,
      28·4-35·1]). Prevalence of non-cognitive neurological manifestations in
      the DIAN-OBS cohort was low, including myoclonus and spasticity (9·3%, 95%
      CI 3·8-15·0), and seizures (2·8%, 0·5-5·9) and moderate for parkinsonism
      (11·2%, 5·3-17·1). By constrast, prevalence was higher in the published
      data cohort for myoclonus and spasticity (19·4%, 16·6-22·2 and 15·0%,
      12·5-17·6, respectively), parkinsonism (12·5%, 10·1-15·0), and seizures
      (20·3%, 17·4-23·2). In an analysis of the published data cohort, ischaemic
      stroke was more prevalent at older ages of onset of symptoms of ADAD (odds
      ratio 1·09 per 1 year increase in age of onset, 95% CI 1·04-1·14,
      p=0·0003); and motor symptoms were more common at younger age of onset
      (myoclonus 0·93, 0·90-0·97, p=0·0007; seizures 0·95, 0·92-0·98, p=0·0018;
      corticobulbar deficits 0·91, 0·86-0·96, p=0·0012; and cerebellar ataxia
      0·82, 0·74-0·91, p=0·0002). In the DIAN-OBS cohort, non-cognitive symptoms
      were more common at more severe stages of disease.

      INTERPRETATION:

      The non-cognitive clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease seem to
      affect a small proportion of participants with mild to moderate ADAD, and
      are probably influenced by disease severity, environmental, and genetic
      factors. When evaluating patients with potential ADAD, clinicians should
      note that cognitive symptoms typical of sporadic Alzheimer's disease are
      the most consistent finding, with some patients manifesting non-cognitive
      neurological symptoms. Future work is needed to determine the
      environmental and genetic factors that cause these neurological symptoms.

      Does posterior cingulate hypometabolism result from disconnection or local
      pathology across preclinical and clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease?
    journal: "Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging "
    volume: 43
    issue: 3
    pages: 526-536
    abstract: >-
      PURPOSE:

      Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) hypometabolism as measured by FDG PET is
      an indicator of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in prodromal stages, such as in
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and has been found to be closely
      associated with hippocampus atrophy in AD dementia. We studied the effects
      of local and remote atrophy and of local amyloid load on the PCC metabolic
      signal in patients with different preclinical and clinical stages of AD.

      METHODS:

      We determined the volume of the hippocampus and PCC grey matter based on
      volumetric MRI scans, PCC amyloid load based on AV45 PET, and PCC
      metabolism based on FDG PET in 667 subjects participating in the
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative spanning the range from
      cognitively normal ageing through prodromal AD to AD dementia.

      RESULTS:

      In cognitively normal individuals and those with early MCI, PCC
      hypometabolism was exclusively associated with hippocampus atrophy,
      whereas in subjects with late MCI it was associated with both local and
      remote effects of atrophy as well as local amyloid load. In subjects with
      AD dementia, PCC hypometabolism was exclusively related to local atrophy.

      CONCLUSION:

      Our findings suggest that the effects of remote pathology on PCC
      hypometabolism decrease and the effects of localpathology increase from
      preclinical to clinical

      The Role of Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Stroke in Familial Alzheimer
      Disease
    journal: "JAMA Neurol "
    volume: 73
    issue: 10
    pages: 1231-1237

      IMPORTANCE:

      The contribution of cardiovascular disease (CV) and cerebrovascular
      disease to the risk for late-onset Alzheimer disease(LOAD) has been long
      debated. Investigations have shown that antecedent CV risk factors
      increase the risk for LOAD, although other investigations have failed to
      validate this association.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To study the contribution of CV risk factors (type 2 diabetes,
      hypertension, and heart disease) and the history of stroke to LOAD in a
      data set of large families multiply affected by LOAD.

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:

      The National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease/National Cell
      Repository for Alzheimer Disease family study (hereinafter referred to as
      NIA-AD FBS study) is a longitudinal study of families with multiple
      members affected with LOAD. A multiethnic community-based longitudinal
      study (Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project [WHICAP]) was used
      to replicate findings. The 6553 participants in the NIA-AD FBS study were
      recruited from 23 US Alzheimer disease centers with ongoing data
      collection since 2003; the 5972 WHICAP participants were recruited at
      Columbia University with ongoing data collection since 1992. Data analysis
      was performed from 2003 to 2015.

      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:

      Generalized mixed logistic regression models tested the association of CV
      risk factors (primary association) with LOAD. History of stroke was used
      for the secondary association. A secondary model adjusted for the presence
      of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A genetic risk score, based on
      common variants associated with LOAD, was used to account for LOAD genetic
      risk beyond the APOE ε4 effect. Mediation analyses evaluated stroke as a
      mediating factor between the primary association and LOAD.

      RESULTS:

      A total of 6553 NIA-AD FBS participants were included in the analyses
      (4044 women [61.7%]; 2509 men [38.3%]; mean [SD] age, 77.0 [9] years),
      with 5972 individuals from the WHICAP study included in the replication
      sample (4072 women [68.2%]; 1900 men [31.8%]; mean [SD] age, 76.5 [7.0]
      years). Hypertension was associated with decreased LOAD risk (odds ratio
      [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.72); type 2 diabetes and heart disease were
      not. History of stroke conferred greater than 2-fold increased risk for
      LOAD (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.75-2.83). Adjustment for APOE ε4 did not alter
      results. The genetic risk score was associated with LOAD (OR, 2.85; 95%
      CI, 2.05-3.97) but did not change the independent association of LOAD with
      hypertension or stroke. In the WHICAP sample, hypertension was not
      associated with LOAD (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11), whereas history of
      stroke increased the risk for LOAD (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.56-2.46). The
      effect of hypertension on LOAD risk was also mediated by stroke in the
      NIA-AD FBS and the WHICAP samples.

      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

      In familial and sporadic LOAD, a history of stroke was significantly
      associated with increased diseaserisk and mediated the association between
      selected CV risk factors and LOAD, which appears to be independent of the
      LOAD-related genetic background.

      Rare coding mutations identified by sequencing of Alzheimer disease
      genome-wide association studies loci
    journal: "Ann Neurol "
    volume: 78
    issue: 3
    pages: 487-498
    abstract: >-
      OBJECTIVE:

      To detect rare coding variants underlying loci detected by genome-wide
      association studies (GWAS) of late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD).

      METHODS:

      We conducted targeted sequencing of ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, CLU, CR1, EPHA1,
      MS4A4A/MS4A6A, and PICALM in 3 independent LOAD cohorts: 176 patients from
      124 Caribbean Hispanics families, 120 patients and 33 unaffected
      individuals from the 129 National Institute on Aging LOAD Family Study;
      and 263 unrelated Canadian individuals of European ancestry (210 sporadic
      patients and 53 controls). Rare coding variants found in at least 2 data
      sets were genotyped in independent groups of ancestry-matched controls.
      Additionally, the Exome Aggregation Consortium was used as a reference
      data set for population-based allele frequencies.

      RESULTS:

      Overall we detected a statistically significant 3.1-fold enrichment of the
      nonsynonymous mutations in the Caucasian LOAD cases compared with controls
      (p = 0.002) and no difference in synonymous variants. A stop-gain mutation
      in ABCA7 (E1679X) and missense mutation in CD2AP (K633R) were highly
      significant in Caucasian LOAD cases, and mutations in EPHA1 (P460L) and
      BIN1 (K358R) were significant in Caribbean Hispanic families with LOAD.
      The EPHA1 variant segregated completely in an extended Caribbean Hispanic
      family and was also nominally significant in the Caucasians. Additionally,
      BIN1 (K358R) segregated in 2 of the 6 Caribbean Hispanic families where
      the mutations were discovered.

      INTERPRETATION:

      Targeted sequencing of confirmed GWAS loci revealed an excess burden of
      deleterious coding mutations in LOAD, with the greatest burden observed in
      ABCA7 and BIN1. Identifying coding variants in LOAD will facilitate the
      creation of tractable models for investigation of disease-related
      mechanisms and potential therapies.

      The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 3: Continued innovation
      for clinical trial improvement
    journal: Alzheimers Dement
    abstract: >-
      INTRODUCTION:

      The overall goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
      is to validate biomarkers for Alzheimer'sdisease (AD) clinical trials.
      ADNI-3, which began on August 1, 2016, is a 5-year renewal of the current
      ADNI-2 study.

      METHODS:

      ADNI-3 will follow current and additional subjects with normal cognition,
      mild cognitive impairment, and AD using innovative technologies such as
      tau imaging, magnetic resonance imaging sequences for connectivity
      analyses, and a highly automated immunoassay platform and mass
      spectroscopy approach for cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis. A
      Systems Biology/pathway approach will be used to identify genetic factors
      for subject selection/enrichment. Amyloid positron emission tomography
      scanning will be standardized using the Centiloid method. The Brain Health
      Registry will help recruit subjects and monitor subject cognition.

      RESULTS:

      Multimodal analyses will provide insight into AD pathophysiology and
      disease progression.

      DISCUSSION:

      ADNI-3 will aim to inform AD treatment trials and facilitate development
      of AD disease-modifying treatments.

      Phosphatidylinositolbinding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) gene is one
      novel genetic player associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease
      (LOAD), based on recent genome wide association studies (GWAS). However,
      how it affects AD occurrence is still unknown. Brain reserve hypothesis
      highlights the tolerant capacities of brain as a passive means to fight
      against neurodegenerations. Here, we took the baseline volume and/or
      thickness of LOAD-associated brain regions as proxies of brain reserve
      capacities and investigated whether PICALMgenetic variations can influence
      the baseline reserve capacities and the longitudinal atrophy rate of these
      specific regions using data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
      Initiative (ADNI) dataset. In mixed population, we found that brain region
      significantly affected by PICALMgenetic variations was majorly restricted
      to posterior cingulate. In sub-population analysis, we found that one
      PICALM variation (C allele of rs642949) was associated with larger
      baseline thickness of posterior cingulate in health. We found seven
      variations in health and two variations (rs543293 and rs592297) in
      individuals with mild cognitive impairment were associated with slower
      atrophy rate of posteriorcingulate. Our study provided preliminary
      evidences supporting that PICALM variations render protections by
      facilitating reserve capacities of posterior cingulate in non-demented
      elderly.

      Decision tree analysis of genetic risk for clinically heterogeneous
      Alzheimer's disease
    journal: "BMC Neurol "
    volume: 15
    pages: 47
    abstract: >-
      BACKGROUND:

      Heritability of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is estimated at 74% and genetic
      contributors have been widely sought. The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E
      (APOE) remains the strongest common risk factor for AD, with numerous
      other common variants contributing only modest risk for disease.
      Variability in clinical presentation of AD, which is typically amnestic
      (AmnAD) but can less commonly involve visuospatial, language and/or
      dysexecutive syndromes (atypical or AtAD), further complicates genetic
      analyses. Taking a multi-locus approach may increase the ability to
      identify individuals at highest risk for any AD syndrome. In this study,
      we sought to develop and investigate the utility of a multi-variant
      genetic risk assessment on a cohort of phenotypically heterogeneous
      patients with sporadic AD clinical diagnoses.

      METHODS:

      We genotyped 75 variants in our cohort and, using a two-staged study
      design, we developed a 17-marker AD risk score in a Discovery cohort
      (n = 59 cases, n = 133 controls) then assessed its utility in a second
      Validation cohort (n = 126 cases, n = 150 controls). We also performed a
      data-driven decision tree analysis to identify genetic and/or demographic
      criteria that are most useful for accurately differentiating all AD cases
      from controls.

      RESULTS:

      We confirmed APOE ε4 as a strong risk factor for AD. A 17-marker risk
      panel predicted AD significantly better than APOE genotype alone
      (P &lt; 0.00001) in the Discovery cohort, but not in the Validation
      cohort. In decision tree analyses, we found that APOE best differentiated
      cases from controls only in AmnAD but not AtAD. In AtAD, HFE SNP rs1799945
      was the strongest predictor of disease; variation in HFE has previously
      been implicated in AD risk in non-ε4 carriers.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      Our study suggests that APOE ε4 remains the best predictor of broad AD
      risk when compared to multiple other geneticfactors with modest effects,
      that phenotypic heterogeneity in broad AD can complicate simple polygenic
      risk modeling, and supports the association between HFE and AD risk in
      individuals without APOE ε4.

      Association Between Genetic Traits for Immune-Mediated Diseases and
      Alzheimer Disease
    journal: "JAMA Neurol "
    volume: 73
    issue: 6
    pages: 697
    abstract: >-
      IMPORTANCE:

      Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia,
      places a large burden on families and society. Although epidemiological
      and clinical evidence suggests a relationship between inflammation and AD,
      their relationship is not well understood and could have implications for
      treatment and prevention strategies.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To determine whether a subset of genes involved with increased risk of
      inflammation are also associated with increased risk for AD.

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:

      In a genetic epidemiology study conducted in July 2015, we systematically
      investigated geneticoverlap between AD (International Genomics of
      Alzheimer's Project stage 1) and Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis,
      rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and psoriasis using
      summary data from genome-wide association studies at multiple academic
      clinical research centers. P values and odds ratios from genome-wide
      association studies of more than 100 000 individuals were from previous
      comparisons of patients vs respective control cohorts. Diagnosis for each
      disorder was previously established for the parent study using consensus
      criteria.

      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:

      The primary outcome was the pleiotropic (conjunction) false discovery rate
      P value. Follow-up for candidate variants included neuritic plaque and
      neurofibrillary tangle pathology; longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease
      Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores as a measure of cognitive
      dysfunction (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative); and gene
      expression in AD vs control brains (Gene Expression Omnibus data).

      RESULTS:

      Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (false discovery rate P &lt; .05)
      were associated with both AD and immune-mediateddiseases. Of these,
      rs2516049 (closest gene HLA-DRB5; conjunction false discovery rate P = .04
      for AD and psoriasis, 5.37 × 10-5 for AD, and 6.03 × 10-15 for psoriasis)
      and rs12570088 (closest gene IPMK; conjunction false discovery rate
      P = .009 for AD and Crohn disease, P = 5.73 × 10-6 for AD, and 6.57 × 10-5
      for Crohn disease) demonstrated the same direction of allelic effect
      between AD and the immune-mediated diseases. Both rs2516049 and rs12570088
      were significantly associated with neurofibrillary tangle pathology
      (P = .01352 and .03151, respectively); rs2516049 additionally correlated
      with longitudinal decline on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale
      cognitive subscale scores (β [SE], 0.405 [0.190]; P = .03). Regarding gene
      expression, HLA-DRA and IPMK transcript expression was significantly
      altered in AD brains compared with control brains (HLA-DRA: β [SE], 0.155
      [0.024]; P = 1.97 × 10-10; IPMK: β [SE], -0.096 [0.013];
      P = 7.57 × 10-13).

      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

      Our findings demonstrate genetic overlap between AD and immune-mediated
      diseases and suggest that immune system processes influence AD
      pathogenesis and progression.

      Association of Cerebrospinal Fluid Neurofilament Light Concentration With
      Alzheimer Disease Progression
    journal: JAMA Neurol
    volume: 73
    issue: 1
    pages: 60-67
    abstract: >-
      IMPORTANCE:

      The extent to which large-caliber axonal degeneration contributes to
      Alzheimer disease (AD) progression is unknown. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      neurofilament light (NFL) concentration is a general marker of damage to
      large-caliber myelinated axons.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To test whether CSF NFL concentration is associated with cognitive decline
      and imaging evidence of neurodegeneration and white matter change in AD.

      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:

      A commercially available immunoassay was used to analyze CSF NFL
      concentration in a cohort of patients with AD (n = 95) or mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) (n = 192) and in cognitively normal individuals (n = 110)
      from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The study dates were
      January 2005 to December 2007. The NFL analysis was performed in November
      2014.

      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:

      Correlation was investigated among baseline CSF NFL concentration and
      longitudinal cognitive impairment, white matter change, and regional brain
      atrophy within each diagnostic group.

      RESULTS:

      Cerebrospinal fluid NFL concentration (median [interquartile range]) was
      higher in the AD dementia group (1479 [1134-1842] pg/mL), stable MCI group
      (no progression to AD during follow-up; 1182 [923-1687] pg/mL), and
      progressive MCI group (MCI with progressionto AD dementia during
      follow-up; 1336 [1061-1693] pg/mL) compared with control participants
      (1047 [809-1265] pg/mL) (P &lt; .001 for all) and in the AD dementia group
      compared with the stable MCI group (P = .01). In the MCI group, a higher
      CSF NFL concentration was associated with faster brain atrophy over time
      as measured by changes in whole-brain volume (β = -4177, P = .003),
      ventricular volume (β = 1835, P &lt; .001), and hippocampus volume
      (β = -54.22, P &lt; .001); faster disease progression as reflected by
      decreased Mini-Mental State Examination scores (β = -1.077, P &lt; .001)
      and increased Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores
      (β = 2.30, P &lt; .001); and faster white matter intensity change
      (β = 598.7, P &lt; .001).

      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:

      Cerebrospinal fluid NFL concentration is increased by the early clinical
      stage of AD and is associated with cognitive deterioration and structural
      brain changes over time. This finding corroborates the contention that
      degeneration of large-caliber axons is an important feature of AD
      neurodegeneration.

      Bayesian model reveals latent atrophy factors with dissociable cognitive
      trajectories in Alzheimer's disease
    journal: "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A "
    volume: 113
    issue: 42
    pages: E6535-e6544
    abstract: >-
      We used a data-driven Bayesian model to automatically identify distinct
      latent factors of overlapping atrophy patterns from voxelwise structural
      MRIs of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients. Our
      approach estimated the extent to which multiple distinct atrophy patterns
      were expressed within each participant rather than assuming that each
      participant expressed a single atrophy factor. The model revealed a
      temporal atrophy factor (medial temporal cortex, hippocampus, and
      amygdala), a subcortical atrophy factor (striatum, thalamus, and
      cerebellum), and a cortical atrophy factor (frontal, parietal, lateral
      temporal, and lateral occipital cortices). To explore the influence of
      each factor in early AD, atrophy factor compositions were inferred in
      beta-amyloid-positive (Aβ+) mild cognitively impaired (MCI) and
      cognitively normal (CN) participants. All three factors were associated
      with memory decline across the entire clinical spectrum, whereas the
      cortical factor was associated with executive function decline in Aβ+ MCI
      participants and AD dementia patients. Direct comparison between factors
      revealed that the temporal factor showed the strongest association with
      memory, whereas the cortical factor showed the strongest association with
      executive function. The subcortical factor was associated with the slowest
      decline for both memory and executive function compared with temporal and
      cortical factors. These results suggest that distinct patterns of atrophy
      influence decline across different cognitive domains. Quantification of
      this heterogeneity may enable the computation of individual-level
      predictions relevant for diseasemonitoring and customized therapies.
      Factor compositions of participants and code used in this article are
      publicly available for future research.
